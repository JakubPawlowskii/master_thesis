  abstract = {A quantum dot is a sub-micron-scale conducting device containing up to several thousand electrons. Transport through a quantum dot at low temperatures is a quantum-coherent process. This review focuses on dots in which the electron's dynamics are chaotic or diffusive, giving rise to statistical properties that reflect the interplay between one-body chaos, quantum interference, and electron-electron interactions. The conductance through such dots displays mesoscopic fluctuations as a function of gate voltage, magnetic field, and shape deformation. The techniques used to describe these fluctuations include semiclassical methods, random-matrix theory, and the supersymmetric nonlinear {$\sigma$} model. In open dots, the approximation of noninteracting quasiparticles is justified, and electron-electron interactions contribute indirectly through their effect on the dephasing time at finite temperature. In almost-closed dots, where conductance occurs by tunneling, the charge on the dot is quantized, and electron-electron interactions play an important role. Transport is dominated by Coulomb blockade, leading to peaks in the conductance that at low temperatures provide information on the dot's ground-state properties. Several statistical signatures of electron-electron interactions have been identified, most notably in the dot's addition spectrum. The dot's spin, determined partly by exchange interactions, can also influence the fluctuation properties of the conductance. Other mesoscopic phenomena in quantum dots that are affected by the charging energy include the fluctuations of the cotunneling conductance and mesoscopic Coulomb blockade.},

  abstract = {Quantum Thermodynamics is a continuous dialogue between two independent theories: Thermodynamics and Quantum Mechanics. Whenever the two theories have addressed the same phenomena new insight has emerged. We follow the dialogue from equilibrium Quantum Thermodynamics and the notion of entropy and entropy inequalities which are the base of the II-law. Dynamical considerations lead to nonequilibrium thermodynamics of quantum Open Systems. The central part played by completely positive maps is discussed leading to the Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan ''GKLS'' equation. We address the connection to thermodynamics through the system-bath weak-coupling-limit WCL leading to dynamical versions of the I-law. The dialogue has developed through the analysis of quantum engines and refrigerators. Reciprocating and continuous engines are discussed. The autonomous quantum absorption refrigerator is employed to illustrate the III-law. Finally, we describe some open questions and perspectives.},

The conventional Lanczos approach consists of finding the ground state in a first step, followed by an approximation for the resolvent of the Hamiltonian in a second step. We analyze the character of this approximation and discuss a numerically exact variant of the Lanczos method which is formulated in the time domain. This method is extended to obtain the nonequilibrium single-particle Green's function defined on the Keldysh\textendash Matsubara contour in the complex time plane which describes the system's nonperturbative response to a sudden parameter switch in the Hamiltonian. The proposed method will be important as an exact-diagonalization solver in the context of self-consistent or variational cluster-embedding schemes. For the recently developed nonequilibrium cluster-perturbation theory, we discuss its efficient implementation and demonstrate the feasibility of the Krylov-based solver. The dissipation of a strong local magnetic excitation into a non-interacting bath is considered as an example for applications.},

We discuss the current state of the art, with emphasis on weakly inhomogeneous potentials, generalized Boltzmann equations and collision integrals, as well as bound-state recombination effects.

Performing the largest classical-statistical simulations to date, we find that the dynamics of the longitudinally expanding plasma becomes independent of the details of the initial conditions. After a transient regime dominated by plasma instabilities and free streaming, the subsequent space-time evolution is governed by a nonthermal fixed point, where the system exhibits the self-similar dynamics characteristic of wave turbulence. This allows us to distinguish between different kinetic scenarios in the classical regime. Within the accuracy of our simulations, the scaling behavior found is consistent with the "bottom-up" thermalization scenario [R. Baier, A.H. Mueller, D. Schiff, and D.T. Son, Phys. Lett.

Levels with very different quantum numbers can have similar energies. We study the classical limit of the distribution P(S) of spacings between adjacent levels, using a scaling transformation to remove the irrelevant effects of the varying local mean level density. For generic regular systems P(S) = e -s , characteristic of a Poisson process with levels distributed at random. But for systems of harmonic oscillators, which possess the non-generic property that the `energy contours' in action space are flat, P(S) does not exist if the oscillator frequencies are commensurable, and is peaked about a non-zero value of S if the frequencies are incommensurable, indicating some regularity in the level distribution; the precise form of P(S) depends on the arithmetic nature of the irrational frequency ratios. Numerical experiments on simple two-dimensional systems support these theoretical conclusions.},

Of course, isolated systems are by nature finite and the main way of computing such quantities is through numerical evaluation for finite-size systems. Therefore, the finite-size scaling of the fluctuations of eigenstate expectation values is a central aspect of the ETH. In this work, we present numerical evidence that for generic nonintegrable systems these fluctuations scale with a universal power law D-1/2 with the dimension D of the Hilbert space. We provide heuristic arguments, in the same spirit as the ETH, to explain this universal result. Our results are based on the analysis of three families of models and several observables for each model. Each family includes integrable members and we show how the system size where the universal power law becomes visible is affected by the proximity to integrability.},

The system is studied in a 11 degree 2 of freedom Hamiltonian setting with two parameters, where a spatio-temporal symmetry is taken into account. Our explorations are restricted to large regions of coherent dynamics in phase space and parameter plane. At any given parameter point we restrict to a bounded subset of phase space, using KAM theory to exclude an infinitely large region with rather trivial dynam- ics. In the absence of forcing the system is integrable. Analytical and numer- ical methods are used to study the dynamics in a parameter region away from integrability, where the analytic results of a perturbation analysis of the nearly integrable case are used as a starting point. We organize the dynam- ics by dividing the parameter plane in fundamental domains, guided by the linearized system at the upper and lower equilibria. Away from integrability some features of the nearly integrable coherent dynamics persist, while new bifurcations arise. On the other hand, the chaotic region increases.},

Numerical advances, based on tensor-network methods, have shown that transport in many canonical integrable spin chains\textemdash most famously the Heisenberg model\textemdash is anomalous. Concurrently, the framework of generalized hydrodynamics has been extended to explain some of the mechanisms underlying anomalous transport. We present what is currently understood about these mechanisms, and discuss how they resemble (and differ from) the mechanisms for anomalous transport in other contexts. We also briefly review potential transport anomalies in systems where integrability is an emergent or approximate property. We survey instances of anomalous transport and dynamics that remain to be understood.},

  abstract = {Integrable quantum systems of finite size are generically robust against weak enough integrability-breaking perturbations, but become quantum chaotic and thermalizing if the integrability-breaking is strong enough. We argue that the onset of quantum chaos can be described as a Fock-space delocalization process, with the eigenstates of the integrable system being taken as the "Fock states". The integrability-breaking perturbation introduces hopping in this Fock space, and chaos sets in when this hopping delocalizes the many-body eigenstates in this space. Depending on the range of the dominant Fock-space hopping, delocalization can occur either through a crossover, or via a transition that becomes sharp in the appropriate large-system dynamic limit. In either case, the perturbation strength at the onset of chaos scales to zero in the usual thermodynamic limit, with a size-dependence that we estimate analytically and compute numerically for a few specific models. We also identify two intermediate finite-size-dependent regimes: There is generally an intermediate nonchaotic regime in which integrability is broken strongly enough to produce some system-wide many-body resonances but not enough to thermalize the system. In spatially extended systems (but not in quantum dots) there is also a crossover or transition between chaotic regimes where the ratio of the system size to the mean free path of the quasiparticles of the integrable system is small versus large compared to unity.},

Here we show that by appropriately tuning the inter-particle interactions, lattice models of chaotic fermions at infinite temperature can be made to cross over from an overdamped regime of diffusion to an underdamped regime of "hot band sound". We study a family of one-dimensional spinless fermion chains with long-range density-density interactions, in which the damping time of sound waves can be made arbitrarily long even as an effective interaction strength is held fixed. Our results demonstrate that underdamped sound waves of charge density can arise within a single band, far from integrability, and at very high temperature.},

These are exact results that constitute the fulcrum of the recent development of nonequilibrium thermodynamics beyond the linear response regime. The material is organized in a way that emphasizes the historical connection between quantum fluctuation relations and (non)linear response theory. A number of fundamental issues are clarified which were not completely settled in the prior literature.

Nevertheless for large system size one observes temporal typicality. Namely, for the overwhelming majority of the time instants, the statistics of observables is practically indistinguishable from an effective equilibrium one. In this paper we consider the Loschmidt echo (LE) to study this sort of unitary equilibration after a quench. We draw several conclusions on general grounds and on the basis of an exactly solvable example of a quasifree system. In particular we focus on the whole probability distribution of observing a given value of the LE after waiting a long time. Depending on the interplay between the initial state and the quench Hamiltonian, we find different regimes reflecting different equilibration dynamics. When the perturbation is small and the system is away from criticality the probability distribution is Gaussian. However close to criticality the distribution function approaches a double-peaked, universal form.},

  abstract = {The dynamics and thermalization of classical systems have been extensively studied in the past. However, the corresponding quantum phenomena remain, to a large extent, uncharted territory. Recent experiments with ultracold quantum gases have at last allowed exploration of the coherent dynamics of isolated quantum systems, as well as observation of non-equilibrium phenomena that challenge our current understanding of the dynamics of quantum manybody systems. These experiments have also posed many new questions. How can we control the dynamics to engineer new states of matter? Given that quantum dynamics is unitary, under which conditions can we expect observables of the system to reach equilibrium values that can be predicted by conventional statistical mechanics? And, how do the observables dynamically approach their statistical equilibrium values? Could the approach to equilibrium be hampered if the system is trapped in long-lived metastable states characterized, for example, by a certain distribution of topological defects? How does the dynamics depend on the way the system is perturbed, such as changing, as a function of time and at a given rate, a parameter across a quantum critical point? What if, conversely, after relaxing to a steady state, the observables cannot be described by the standard equilibrium ensembles of statistical mechanics? How would they depend on the initial conditions in addition to the other properties of the system, such as the existence of conserved quantities? The search for answers to questions like these is fundamental to a new research field that is only beginning to be explored, and to which researchers with different backgrounds, such as nuclear, atomic, and condensed-matter physics, as well as quantum optics, can make, and are making, important contributions. This body of knowledge has an immediate application to experiments in the field of ultracold atomic gases, but can also fundamentally change the way we approach and understand many-body quantum systems. This focus issue of New Journal Physics brings together both experimentalists and theoreticians working on these problems to provide a comprehensive picture of the state of the field. \textcopyright{} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

We show that this environment is effectively separated into a set of individual proximal 13C nuclear spins, which are coupled coherently to the electron spin, and the remainder of the 13C nuclear spins, which cause the loss of coherence. The proximal nuclear spins can be addressed and coupled individually because of quantum back-action from the electron, which modifies their energy levels and magnetic moments, effectively distinguishing them from the rest of the nuclei. These results open the door to coherent manipulation of individual isolated nuclear spins in a solid-state environment even at room temperature.},

A peculiar feature of this instability results in an irregular, or stochastic, motion of the system as if the latter were influenced by a random perturbation even though, in fact, the motion is governed by purely dynamical equations. The instability takes place generally for very special initial conditions (inside the so-called stochastic layers) which are, however, everywhere dense in the phase space of the systsm. The basic and simplest one of the models considered is that of a pendulum under an external periodic perturbation. This model represents the behavior of nonlinear oscillations near a resonance, including the phenomenon of the stochastic instability within the stochastic layer of resonance. All models are treated both analytically and numerically. Some general regulations concerning the stochastic instability are presented, including a general, semi-quantitative method-the overlap criterion-to estimate the conditions for this stochastic instability as well as its main characteristics. \textcopyright{} 1979.},

These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force measurements and have already provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin. Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem can be used to determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical tweezers to measure repeatedly the mechanical work associated with the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin and an RNA three-helix junction. The resultant work distributions are then analysed according to the theorem and allow us to determine the difference in folding free energy between an RNA molecule and a mutant differing only by one base pair, and the thermodynamic stabilizing effect of magnesium ions on the RNA structure. \textcopyright{} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

The system consists of interacting spinless fermions and is driven by a time\textendash dependent magnetic flux. The energy current is defined by the continuity equation for the energy density which is derived both for homogeneous as well as for inhomogeneous systems. Since the total energy is not conserved in the driven system, the continuity equation includes the source terms which are shown to represent the Joule heating effects. For short times and weak drivings the energy current agrees with the linear response theory. For stronger fields or longer times of driving the system enters the quasiequilibrium regime when the energy current gradually diminishes due to the heating effects. Finally, for even stronger driving the energy current is shown to undergo a damped Bloch oscillations. The energy spread also increases upon driving. However, the time\textendash dependence of this quantity in the low field regime is quite unexpected since it is determined mostly by the time of driving being quite independent of the instantaneous energy of the system.},

This issue has remained elusive as electronic correlations are expected to greatly accelerate the electron\textendash boson scattering processes, confining them to the very femtosecond timescale that is hard to access even with state-of-the-art ultrafast techniques. Here we simultaneously push the time resolution and frequency range of transient reflectivity measurements up to an unprecedented level, enabling us to directly observe the {$\sim$}16 fs build-up of the effective electron\textendash boson interaction in hole-doped copper oxides. This extremely fast timescale is in agreement with numerical calculations based on the t\textendash J model and the repulsive Hubbard model, in which the relaxation of the photo-excited charges is achieved via inelastic scattering with short-range antiferromagnetic excitations.},

  abstract = {This review gives a pedagogical introduction to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), its basis, and its implications to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We introduce the concept of the generalized Gibbs ensemble, and discuss its connection with ideas of prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.},

The idea was to simulate the one-dimensional analogue of atoms in a crystal: a long chain of masses linked by springs that obey Hooke's law (a linear interaction), but with a weak nonlinear term. A purely linear interaction would ensure that energy introduced into a single Fourier vibrational mode always remains in that mode; the nonlinear term allows the transfer of energy between modes. Under certain conditions, the weakly nonlinear system exhibits surprising behavior: The energy does not drift toward the equipartition predicted by statistical physics but periodically returns to the original mode. That highly remarkable result, known as the FPU paradox, shows that nonlinearity is not enough to guarantee the equipartition of energy. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Here we review how similar questions can be answered in quantum systems. The crucial point is that individual energy eigenstates behave in many ways like a statistical ensemble. A more detailed statement of this is named the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). The reasons for why it works in so many cases are rooted in the early work of Wigner on random matrix theory and our understanding of quantum chaos. The ETH has now been studied extensively by both analytic and numerical means, and applied to a number of physical situations ranging from black hole physics to condensed matter systems. It has recently become the focus of a number of experiments in highly isolated systems. Current theoretical work also focuses on where the ETH breaks down leading to new interesting phenomena. This review of the ETH takes a somewhat intuitive approach as to why it works and how this informs our understanding of many body quantum states.},

Accordingly, the review is divided into two parts. The first part revolves around a quantum version of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism including also phenomena that go beyond this simple paradigm. What they have in common is that excitation of a gapless many-body system scales with a power of the driving rate. The second part attempts a systematic presentation of recent results and conjectures on apparent relaxation of a pure state of an isolated quantum many-body system after its excitation by a sudden quench. This research is motivated in part by recent experimental developments in the physics of ultracold atoms with potential applications in the adiabatic quantum state preparation and quantum computation. \textcopyright{} 2010 Taylor \& Francis.},

And how do these systems thermalize, given that they comprise so many degrees of freedom? Progress in answering these - and related - questions has accelerated in recent years - a trend that can be partially attributed to success with experiments performing quantum simulations using ultracold atoms and trapped ions. Here we provide an overview of this progress, specifically in studies probing dynamical equilibration and thermalization of systems driven out of equilibrium by quenches, ramps and periodic driving. In doing so, we also address topics such as the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, typicality, transport, many-body localization and universality near phase transitions, as well as future prospects for quantum simulation.},

We use the insights gained from this relation to show that high-temperature time correlation functions in many-body quantum systems can be controllably computed without complete diagonalization of the Hamiltonians, using instead the direct integration of the Schr\"odinger equation for randomly sampled pure states. This method is also applicable to quantum quenches and other situations describable by time-dependent many-body Hamiltonians. The method implies exponential reduction of the computer memory requirement in comparison with the complete diagonalization. We illustrate the method by numerically computing infinite-temperature correlation functions for translationally invariant Heisenberg chains of up to 29 spins 1/2. Thereby, we also test the spin diffusion hypothesis and find it in a satisfactory agreement with the numerical results. Both the derivation of the modified regression relation and the justification of the computational method are based on the notion of quantum typicality.},

This 2005 book presents a coherent, self-contained account of the exact solution of the Hubbard model in one dimension. The early chapters will be accessible to beginning graduate students with a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. The later chapters address more advanced topics, and are intended as a guide for researchers to some of the more topical results in the field of integrable models.},

  abstract = {The usefulness of matrix theory as a tool in disciplines ranging from quantum mechanics to psychometrics is widely recognized, and courses in matrix theory are increasingly a standard part of the undergraduate curriculum.This outstanding text offers an unusual introduction to matrix theory at the undergraduate level. Unlike most texts dealing with the topic, which tend to remain on an abstract level, Dr. Eves' book employs a concrete elementary approach, avoiding abstraction until the final chapter. This practical method renders the text especially accessible to students of physics, engineering, business and the social sciences, as well as math majors. Although the treatment is fundamental \textemdash{} no previous courses in abstract algebra are required \textemdash{} it is also flexible: each chapter includes special material for advanced students interested in deeper study or application of the theory.The book begins with preliminary remarks that set the stage for the author's concrete approach to matrix theory and the consideration of matrices as hypercomplex numbers. Dr. Eves then goes on to cover fundamental concepts and operations, equivalence, determinants, matrices with polynomial elements, similarity and congruence. A final optional chapter considers matrix theory from a generalized or abstract viewpoint, extending it to arbitrary number rings and fields, vector spaces and linear transformations of vector spaces. The author's concluding remarks direct the interested student to possible avenues of further study in matrix theory, while an extensive bibliography rounds out the book.Students of matrix theory will especially appreciate the many excellent problems (solutions not provided) included in each chapter, which are not just routine calculation exercises, but involve proof and extension of the concepts and material of the text. Scientists, engineers, economists and others whose work involves this important area of mathematics, will welcome the variety of special types of matrices and determinants discussed, which make the book not only a comprehensive introduction to the field, but a valuable resource and reference work.},

It is well known that local conservation laws constrain the dynamics and, eventually, the stationary behavior of local observables. We show that some widely studied models, such as the quantum XY model, possess extra families of local conservation laws in addition to the translation invariant ones. As a consequence, the additional charges must be included in the generalized Gibbs ensemble that describes the stationary properties. The effects go well beyond a simple redefinition of the stationary state. The time evolution of a nontranslation-invariant state under a (translation-invariant) Hamiltonian with a perturbation that weakly breaks the hidden symmetries underlying the extra conservation laws exhibits pre-relaxation. In addition, in the limit of small perturbation, the time evolution following pre-relaxation can be described by means of a time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble.},

  abstract = {Interacting quantum systems in the chaotic domain are at the core of various ongoing studies of many-body physics, ranging from the scrambling of quantum information to the onset of thermalization. We propose a minimum model for chaos that can be experimentally realized with cold atoms trapped in one-dimensional multi-well potentials. We explore the emergence of chaos as the number of particles is increased, starting with as few as two, and as the number of wells is increased, ranging from a double well to a multi-well Kronig-Penney-like system. In this way, we illuminate the narrow boundary between integrability and chaos in a highly tunable few-body system. We show that the competition between the particle interactions and the periodic structure of the confining potential reveals subtle indications of quantum chaos for 3 particles, while for 4 particles stronger signatures are seen. The analysis is performed for bosonic particles and could also be extended to distinguishable fermions.},

  abstract = {This monograph introduces the reader to basic notions of integrable techniques for one-dimensional quantum systems. In a pedagogical way, a few examples of exactly solvable models are worked out to go from the coordinate approach to the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz, with some discussion on the finite temperature thermodynamics. The aim is to provide the instruments to approach more advanced books or to allow for a critical reading of research articles and the extraction of useful information from them. We describe the solution of the anisotropic XY spin chain; of the Lieb-Liniger model of bosons with contact interaction at zero and finite temperature; and of the XXZ spin chain, first in the coordinate and then in the algebraic approach. To establish the connection between the latter and the solution of two dimensional classical models, we also introduce and solve the 6-vertex model. Finally, the low energy physics of these integrable models is mapped into the corresponding conformal field theory. Through its style and the choice of topics, this book tries to touch all fundamental ideas behind integrability and is meant for students and researchers interested either in an introduction to later delve in the advance aspects of Bethe Ansatz or in an overview of the topic for broadening their culture.},

  abstract = {The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) posits that the reduced density matrix for a subsystem corresponding to an excited eigenstate is "thermal." Here we expound on this hypothesis by asking: for which class of operators, local or non-local, is ETH satisfied? We show that this question is directly related to a seemingly unrelated question: is the Hamiltonian of a system encoded within a single eigenstate? We formulate a strong form of ETH where in the thermodynamic limit, the reduced density matrix of a subsystem corresponding to a pure, finite energy density eigenstate asymptotically becomes equal to the thermal reduced density matrix, as long as the subsystem size is much less than the total system size, irrespective of how large the subsystem is compared to any intrinsic length scale of the system. This allows one to access the properties of the underlying Hamiltonian at arbitrary energy densities/temperatures using just a \$\textbackslash textit\{single\}\$ eigenstate. We provide support for our conjecture by performing an exact diagonalization study of a non-integrable 1D lattice quantum model with only energy conservation. In addition, we examine the case in which the subsystem size is a finite fraction of the total system size, and find that even in this case, a large class of operators continue to match their canonical expectation values. Specifically, the von Neumann entanglement entropy equals the thermal entropy as long as the subsystem is less than half the total system. We also study, both analytically and numerically, a particle number conserving model at infinite temperature which substantiates our conjectures.},

However, the type of the simulated Hamiltonian usually cannot be changed once the system has been engineered, although the parameters can be tuned. Geier               et al               . used rubidium-87 atoms in two excited Rydberg states to create a system in which the type of the Hamiltonian could be modified by periodic driving. The researchers started with a system that was initially described by the so-called Heisenberg XX Hamiltonian. By using a periodic series of pulses, the Hamiltonian was transformed into a different target Hamiltonian, which was corroborated by monitoring the system's dynamics. \textemdash JS                        ,              Ultracold rubidium atoms in a Rydberg state form a basis for a programmable quantum simulator.           ,              Controlling interactions is the key element for the quantum engineering of many-body systems. Using time-periodic driving, a naturally given many-body Hamiltonian of a closed quantum system can be transformed into an effective target Hamiltonian that exhibits vastly different dynamics. We demonstrate such Floquet engineering with a system of spins represented by Rydberg states in an ultracold atomic gas. By applying a sequence of spin manipulations, we change the symmetry properties of the effective Heisenberg XYZ Hamiltonian. As a consequence, the relaxation behavior of the total spin is drastically modified. The observed dynamics can be qualitatively captured by a semiclassical simulation. Engineering a wide range of Hamiltonians opens vast opportunities for implementing quantum simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics in a single experimental setting.},

From this series we can compute the correlation function with very high accuracy up to very long times and large distances. Each term in the series corresponds to the contribution of all scattering states of an even number of excitations. These excitations can be interpreted in terms of an equal number of particles and holes. The lowest term in the series comprises all scattering states of one hole and one particle. This term determines the long-time large-distance asymptotic behaviour which can be obtained explicitly from a saddle-point analysis. The space-time Fourier transform of the two-point function of currents at zero momentum gives the optical spin conductivity of the model. We obtain highly accurate numerical estimates for this quantity by numerically Fourier transforming our data. For the one-particle, one-hole contribution, equivalently interpreted as a two-spinon contribution, we obtain an exact and explicit expression in terms of known special functions. For large enough anisotropy, the two-spinon contribution carries most of the spectral weight, as can be seen by calculating the f-sum rule.},

  abstract = {Many experimentally relevant quantum spin chains are approximately integrable, and support long-lived quasiparticle excitations. A canonical example of integrable model of quantum magnetism is the XXZ spin chain, for which energy spreads ballistically, but, surprisingly, high-temperature spin transport can be diffusive or superdiffusive. We review the transport properties of this model using an intuitive quasiparticle picture that relies on the recently introduced framework of generalized hydrodynamics. We discuss how anomalous linear response properties emerge from hierarchies of quasiparticles both in integrable and near-integrable limits, with an emphasis on the role of hydrodynamic fluctuations. We also comment on recent developments including non-linear response, full-counting statistics and far-fromequilibrium transport. We provide an overview of recent numerical and experimental results on transport in XXZ spin chains.},

  abstract = {A Bose-Einstein condensate represents the most 'classical' form of a matter wave, just as an optical laser emits the most classical form of an electromagnetic wave. Nevertheless, the matter wave field has a quantized structure owing to the granularity of the discrete underlying atoms. Although such a field is usually assumed to be intrinsically stable (apart from incoherent loss processes), this is no longer true when the condensate is in a coherent superposition of different atom number states. For example, in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined by a three-dimensional optical lattice, each potential well can be prepared in a coherent superposition of different atom number states, with constant relative phases between neighbouring lattice sites. It is then natural to ask how the individual matter wave fields and their relative phases evolve. Here we use such a set-up to investigate these questions experimentally, observing that the matter wave field of the Bose-Einstein condensate undergoes a periodic series of collapses and revivals; this behaviour is directly demonstrated in the dynamical evolution of the multiple matter wave interference pattern. We attribute the oscillations to the quantized structure of the matter wave field and the collisions between individual atoms.},

We employ measurements of full quantum mechanical probability distributions of matter-wave interference to study the relaxation dynamics of a coherently split one-dimensional Bose gas and obtain unprecedented information about the dynamical states of the system. Following an initial rapid evolution, the full distributions reveal the approach towards a thermal-like steady state characterized by an effective temperature that is independent from the initial equilibrium temperature of the system before the splitting process. We conjecture that this state can be described through a generalized Gibbs ensemble and associate it with pre-thermalization.},

  abstract = {The relation between the solutions of the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system is examined in the case where neither can be found by the separation of variables. If the quasiclassical approximation for the Green's function is integrated over the coordinates, a response function for the system is obtained which depends only on the energy and whose singularities give the approximate eigenvalues of the energy. This response function is written as a sum over all periodic orbits where each term has a phase factor containing the action integral and the number of conjugate points, as well as an amplitude factor containing the period and the stability exponent of the orbit. In terms of the approximate density of states per unit interval of energy, each stable periodic orbit is shown to yield a series of {$\delta$} functions whose locations are given by a simple quantum condition: The action integral differs from an integer multiple of h by half the stability angle times {$\hslash$}. Unstable periodic orbits give a series of broadened peaks whose half-width equals the stability exponent times {$\hslash$}, whereas the location of the maxima is given again by a simple quantum condition. These results are applied to the anisotropic Kepler problem, i.e., an electron with an anisotropic mass tensor moving in a (spherically symmetric) Coulomb field. A class of simply closed, periodic orbits is found by a Fourier expansion method as in Hill's theory of the moon. They are shown to yield a well-defined set of levels, whose energy is compared with recent variational calculations of Faulkner on shallow bound states of donor impurities in semiconductors. The agreement is good for silicon, but only fair for the more anisotropic germanium.},

  abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed\textemdash either explicitly or implicitly\textemdash to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, robustness, and/or speed. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis. The specific benefits of randomized techniques depend on the computational environment. Consider the model problem of finding the k dominant components of the singular value decomposition of an m \texttimes{} n matrix. (i) For a dense input matrix, randomized algorithms require O(mn log(k)) floating-point operations (flops) in contrast to O(mnk) for classical algorithms. (ii) For a sparse input matrix, the flop count matches classical Krylov subspace methods, but the randomized approach is more robust and can easily be reorganized to exploit multiprocessor architectures. (iii) For a matrix that is too large to fit in fast memory, the randomized techniques require only a constant number of passes over the data, as opposed to O(k) passes for classical algorithms. In fact, it is sometimes possible to perform matrix approximation with a single pass over the data.},

  abstract = {Understanding how isolated quantum systems thermalize has recently gathered renewed interest almost 100 years after the first work by von Neumann, thanks to the experimental realizations of such systems. Experimental and numerical pieces of evidence imply that nonintegrability of the system plays an important role in thermalization. Nonintegrable systems that conserve energy alone are expected to be effectively described by the (micro)canonical ensemble due to the so-called eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, it is expected that stationary states in integrable systems are described not by the canonical ensemble but by the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) due to the existence of many nontrivial conserved quantities. In this thesis, we study thermalization and its mechanism in nonintegrable systems from two perspectives. We first study how well the ETH and its finite-size corrections can be predicted by random matrix theory (RMT). Next, we present our study on the emergence of the GGE in a nonintegrable system with an extensive number of local symmetries.},

We show that, even if the system is initially in thermal equilibrium at finite temperature, the diagonal entropy after a quench remains a fraction of the entropy in the generalized ensembles introduced to describe integrable systems after relaxation. The latter is also, in general, different from the entropy in thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we examine the difference in the distributions of conserved quantities in the thermal versus the generalized ensembles after a quench and show that they are also, in general, different from each other. This explains why these systems fail to thermalize.

By studying weighted energy densities and entropies, we show that quenches starting from nonintegrable (chaotic) eigenstates lead to an "ergodic" sampling of the eigenstates of the final Hamiltonian, while those starting from the integrable eigenstates do not (or at least it is not apparent for the system sizes accessible to us). This goes in parallel with the fact that the distribution of conserved quantities in the initial states is thermal in the nonintegrable cases and nonthermal in the integrable ones, and means that, in general, thermalization occurs in integrable systems when the quench starts form an eigenstate of a nonintegrable Hamiltonian (away from the edges of the spectrum), while it fails (or requires larger system sizes than those studied here to become apparent) for quenches starting at integrable points. We test those conclusions by studying the momentum distribution function of hard-core bosons after a quench. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {Exact diagonalization and other numerical studies of quantum spin systems are notoriously limited by the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with system size. A common and well-known practice to reduce this increasing computational effort is to take advantage of the translational symmetry \$C\_N\$ in periodic systems. This represents a rather simple yet elegant application of the group theoretical symmetry projection operator technique. For isotropic exchange interactions, the spin-rotational symmetry SU(2) can be used, where the Hamiltonian matrix is block-structured according to the total spin- and magnetization quantum numbers. Rewriting the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in terms of irreducible tensor operators allows for an efficient and highly parallelizable implementation to calculate its matrix elements recursively in the spin-coupling basis. When combining both \$C\_N\$ and SU(2), mathematically, the symmetry projection technique leads to ready-to-use formulas. However, the evaluation of these formulas is very demanding in both computation time and memory consumption, problems which are said to outweigh the benefits of the symmetry reduced matrix shape. We show a way to minimize the computational effort for selected systems and present the largest numerically accessible cases.},

By employing fast recombination loss pulses to analyze the occupancy distribution, we observe similarly slow-evolving dynamics, and a lower effective temperature at the center of the sample. \textcopyright{} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

We employ the so-called quantum Markovian semi-group evolution, i.e. a general form of time-autonomous positivity and trace-preserving dynamical equation for reduced density operators, by only allowing unitarity-breaking dissipative terms acting at the boundaries of a system. Such setup enables to simulate macroscopic reservoirs for different values of effective thermodynamic potentials, causing incoherent transitions between quantum states which are modeled with aid of the Lindblad operators. This serves as a simple minimalistic model for studying quantum transport properties, either in the linear response domain or in more general regimes far from canonical equilibrium. We are mainly exploring possibilities of identifying nonequilibrium situations which are amenable to exact description within matrix product state representation, by exclusively focusing on steady states, i.e. fixed points of the Lindblad equation, of certain prototypic interacting integrable spin chains driven by incoherent polarizing processes. Finally, we define a concept of pseudo-local extensive almost-conserved quantities by allowing a violation of time-invariance up to boundary-localized terms. We elucidate the role of such quantities on non-ergodic behaviour of temporal correlation functions rendering anomalous transport properties. It turns out that such conservation laws can be generated by means of boundary universal quantum transfer operators of the fundamental integrable models.},

The central concept concerns the so-called quasilocal conserved quantities, which go beyond the standard perception of locality. Two systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of quasilocal conserved operators based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined, specializing on anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved operators stem from two distinct classes of representations of the auxiliary space algebra, comprised of unitary (compact) representations, which can be naturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle content of the model, and non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise to charges, manifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter applications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are presented, with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport properties (finite Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in the quantum quench scenario.},

A fascinating prediction is that classical hydrodynamics emerges universally in the evolution of any interacting quantum system. Here, we experimentally probe the quantum dynamics of 51 individually controlled ions, realizing a long-range interacting spin chain. By measuring space-time resolved correlation functions in an infinite temperature state, we observe a whole family of hydrodynamic universality classes, ranging from normal diffusion to anomalous superdiffusion, that are described by L\textbackslash 'evy flights. We extract the transport coefficients of the hydrodynamic theory, reflecting the microscopic properties of the system. Our observations demonstrate the potential for engineered quantum systems to provide key insights into universal properties of non-equilibrium states of quantum matter.},

We exploit this to investigate the long-time behavior of current correlation functions of the XXZ spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain. This allows a direct extraction of the Drude weight D at intermediate to large T. We find that D is nonzero\textemdash and thus transport is dissipationless\textemdash everywhere in the gapless phase.

By exploiting time translation invariance within tDMRG, one can extract D for significantly lower temperatures than in previous tDMRG studies. Second, we discuss the numerical quality of the tDMRG data and elaborate on details of the finite-size scaling of the ED results, comparing calculations carried out in the canonical and grand-canonical ensembles. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight as the point with SU(2)-symmetric exchange is approached and discuss the relative contribution of the Drude weight to the sum rule as a function of temperature.},

The integrability of this model gives rise to ballistic thermal transport. We calculate the temperature dependence of the thermal Drude weight at half filling for various interactions and moreover, we compute its filling dependence at infinite temperature. The finite-frequency contributions originating from the fact that the energy current is not a conserved quantity are investigated as well. We report evidence that breaking the integrability through a nearest-neighbor interaction leads to vanishing Drude weights and diffusive energy transport. Moreover, we demonstrate that energy spreads ballistically in local quenches with initially inhomogeneous energy density profiles in the integrable case. We discuss the relevance of our results for thermalization in ultra-cold quantum gas experiments and for transport measurements with quasi-one dimensional materials.},

In this Rapid Communication, we show that the experimental Hamiltonian exhibits nonthermal behavior across its entire many-body spectrum, with similar finite-size scaling properties as models proximate to integrable points. Moreover, we construct an explicit small local deformation of the Hamiltonian which enhances both the signatures of integrability and the coherent oscillations observed after the quench. Our results suggest that a parent proximate integrable point controls the early-to-intermediate time dynamics of the experimental system. The distinctive quench dynamics in the parent model could signal an unconventional class of integrable system.},

We consider the case of a nondegenerate band m. It is then shown that, with an error vanishing with H like HN+1 (N arbitrary), the eigenstates of H can be calculated from an equivalent Hamiltonian \textasciimacron Hm(P) with the following properties: (1) It is a one-band Hamiltonian, obtained by transforming away all relevant interband matrix elements. (2) It depends only on the gauge-covariant operators P{$\alpha$}. (3) It has the periodicity property \textasciimacron Hm(P+K)=\textasciimacron Hm(P), where K is an arbitrary reciprocal lattice vector. (4) It can be written as a series \textasciimacron Hm(P)={$\Sigma$}i=0Nsi\textasciimacron Hm;i(P) where s{$\equiv$}Hc and the functions \textasciimacron Hm;i(P) are completely symmetrized in the noncommuting operators P{$\alpha$}. Properties (3) and (4) can also be summarized in the equations \textasciimacron Hm(P)={$\Sigma$}la(l)\texttimes exp[iR(l){$\cdot$}P], where the R(l) are lattice vectors and the a(l) can be expanded as a(l)={$\Sigma$}i=0Nsiai(l). An algorithm is given for the construction of the \textasciimacron Hm;i and carried through for i=0, 1, 2. The formalism is not restricted to the neighborhood of the bottom and top of the band. We believe that the equivalent Hamiltonian \textasciimacron Hm(P) provides a sound basis for a discussion of wave functions and energy levels of Bloch electrons in a magnetic field.},

  abstract = {The quantum inverse scattering method is a means for finding exact solutions of two-dimensional models in quantum field theory and statistical physics (such as the sine-Gordon equation or the quantum nonlinear Schrodinger equation). These models are the subject of much attention amongst physicists and mathematicians. The present work is an introduction to this important and exciting area. It consists of four parts. The first deals with the Bethe ansatz and calculation of physical quantities. The authors then tackle the theory of the quantum inverse scattering method before applying it in the second half of the book to the calculation of correlation functions. This is one of the most important applications of the method and the authors have made significant contributions to the area. Here they describe some of the most recent and general approaches and include some new results.

In particular, geometrical effects or competing magnetic interactions can give rise to the formation of a spin gap between the singlet ground state and the first excited triplet state. In this chapter, we focus on the numerical investigation of such systems by Exact Diagonalisation methods and some extensions of it including a simultaneous mean-field treatment of some perturbative couplings. After a presentation of the Lanczos algorithm and a description of the space group symmetries, we give a short review on some pure low-dimensionnal frustrated spin gapped systems. In particular, we outline the role of the magnetic frustration in the formation of disordered phase. A large part is also devoted to frustrated Spin-Peierls systems for which the role of interchain couplings as well as impurity doping effects has been studied numerically.},

This concept has for example been used to realize Bose\textendash Einstein condensates of photons, magnons and excitons. Integrable quantum systems, like the one-dimensional Heisenberg model, are characterized by an infinite set of conservation laws. Here, we develop a theory of weakly driven integrable systems and show that pumping can induce large spin or heat currents even in the presence of integrability breaking perturbations, since it activates local and quasi-local approximate conserved quantities. The resulting steady state is qualitatively captured by a truncated generalized Gibbs ensemble with Lagrange parameters that depend on the structure but not on the overall amplitude of perturbations nor the initial state. We suggest to use spin-chain materials driven by terahertz radiation to realize integrability-based spin and heat pumps.},

Conventional thermodynamical ensembles fail to describe the large class of systems that exhibit nontrivial conserved quantities, and generalized ensembles have been predicted to maximize entropy in these systems. We show experimentally that a degenerate one-dimensional Bose gas relaxes to a state that can be described by such a generalized ensemble. This is verified through a detailed study of correlation functions up to 10th order. The applicability of the generalized ensemble description for isolated quantum many-body systems points to a natural emergence of classical statistical properties from the microscopic unitary quantum evolution.},

The use of these concepts raised mathematical problems that they could not solve, but like the good physicists they were they assumed that everything was or could be made all right mathematically and went on with the physics. There is much more to the mathematical study of Gibbs ensembles than the question of whether or not time averages and ensemble averages are equal. \textcopyright{} 1973, American Institute of Physics.

We demonstrate a fourth-order AC Stark shift in a trapped atomic ion system that does not require extra laser power beyond that needed for other control fields. We individually address a chain of tightly-spaced trapped ions and show how these controlled shifts can produce an arbitrary product state of ten ions as well as generate site-specific magnetic field terms in a simulated spin Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {The ability to harness the dynamics of quantum information and entanglement is necessary for the development of quantum technologies and the study of complex quantum systems. On the theoretical side the dynamics of quantum information is a topic that is helping us unify and confront common problems in otherwise disparate fields in physics, such as quantum statistical mechanics and cosmology. On the experimental side the impressive developments on the manipulation of neutral atoms and trapped ions are providing new capabilities to probe their quantum dynamics. Here, we overview and discuss progress in characterizing and understanding the dynamics of quantum entanglement and information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. The level of control attainable over both the internal and external degrees of freedom of individual particles in these systems provides great insight into the intrinsic connection between entanglement and thermodynamics, bounds on information transport and computational complexity of interacting systems. In turn this understanding should enable the realization of quantum technologies.},

In integrable models, the average eigenstate entanglement entropy (over all Hamiltonian eigenstates) has a volume-law coefficient that generally depends on the subsystem fraction. In contrast, it is maximal (subsystem fraction independent) in quantum-chaotic models. Using random matrix theory for quadratic Hamiltonians, we obtain a closed-form expression for the average eigenstate entanglement entropy as a function of the subsystem fraction. We test it against numerical results for the quadratic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and show that it describes the results for the power-law random banded matrix model (in the delocalized regime). We show that localization in quasimomentum space produces (small) deviations from our analytic predictions.},

With the explicit construction at hand, we finally comment on the differences between fully random Hamiltonians and random Gaussian systems, providing a physically motivated notion of randomness of the microscopic quantum state.},

  abstract = {We numerically study the relaxation of correlation functions in weakly perturbed integrable XXZ chain. The decay of the spin-current and the energy-current correlations at zero magnetization are well described by single, but quite distinct, relaxation rates governed by the square of the perturbation strength g . However, at finite magnetization a single correlation function reveals multiple relaxation rates. The result can be understood in terms of multi-scale relaxation scenario, where various relaxation times are linked with various quantities which are conserved in the reference integrable system. On the other hand, the correlations of non-commuting quantities, being conserved at particular anisotropies {$\increment$}, decay non-exponentially with characteristic time scale linear in g .},

The algorithm works for any A, its computational cost is dominated by the formation of products of A with n\texttimes n0n\texttimes n0n\textbackslash textbackslashtimes n\_0 matrices, and the only input parameter is a backward error tolerance. The algorithm can return a single matrix etABetABe\textasciicircum\{tA\}B or a sequence etkABetkABe\textasciicircum\{t\_kA\}B on an equally spaced grid of points tktkt\_k. It uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential. It determines the amount of scaling and the Taylor degree using the recent analysis of Al-Mohy and Higham [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 31 (2009), pp. 970\textendash 989], which provides sharp truncation error bounds expressed in terms of the quantities {$\parallel$}Ak{$\parallel$}1/k{$\Vert$}Ak{$\Vert$}1/k\textbackslash textbackslash\textbackslash textbarA\textasciicircum k\textbackslash textbackslash\textbackslash textbar\textasciicircum\{1/k\} for a few values of k, where the norms are estimated using a matrix norm estimator. Shifting and balancing are used as preprocessing steps to reduce the cost of the algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm performs in a numerically stable fashion across a wide range of problems, and analysis of rounding errors and of the conditioning of the problem provides theoretical support. Experimental comparisons with MATLAB codes based on Krylov subspace, Chebyshev polynomial, and Laguerre polynomial methods show the new algorithm to be sometimes much superior in terms of computational cost and accuracy. An important application of the algorithm is to exponential integrators for ordinary differential equations. It is shown that the sums of the form {$\sum$}pk=0{$\varphi$}k(A)uk{$\sum$}k=0p{$\varphi$}k(A)uk\textbackslash textbackslashsum\_\{k=0\}\textasciicircum p \textbackslash textbackslashvarphi\_k(A)u\_k that arise in exponential integrators, where the {$\varphi$}k{$\varphi$}k\textbackslash textbackslashvarphi\_k are related to the exponential function, can be expressed in terms of a single exponential of a matrix of dimension n+pn+pn+p built by augmenting A with additional rows and columns, and the algorithm of this paper can therefore be employed.},

In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to and an overview of the exact results on weak ergodicity breaking via QMBS in isolated quantum systems with the help of simple examples such as the fermionic Hubbard model. We also discuss various mechanisms and unifying formalisms that have been proposed to encompass the plethora of systems exhibiting QMBS. We cover examples of equally-spaced towers that lead to exact revivals for particular initial states, as well as isolated examples of QMBS. Finally, we review Hilbert Space Fragmentation, a related phenomenon where systems exhibit a richer variety of ergodic and non-ergodic behaviors, and discuss its connections to QMBS.},

These systems can forever locally remember ormation about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum ormation. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden.},

  abstract = {In this work we addressed a central challenge in the study of nearly integrable systems: we developed a Boltzmann equation with a microscopically derived collision integral, to describe the relaxation of the system to equilibrium. This Boltzmann equation is quantitatively accurate for perturbations that fall off slowly in space, e.g., dipolar interactions between integrable chains. This Boltzmann equation applies to arbitrary initial states, though for simplicity we assumed translation invariance. Our main result is that relaxation from the Newton's cradle setup is a process that involves many different timescales: indeed, our numerical results on the linearized Boltzmann equation suggest that relaxation is non-exponential even at the latest times. An important future direction would be to extend our results to spatially inhomogeneous initial states and systems confined in harmonic traps: this would involve combining our Boltzmann equation (applied locally) with the nontrivial evolution of the quasiparticle distributions under generalized hydrodynamics, including space-time inhomogeneities [56]. In experimental setups the gas is confined in a 3D trap. This leads to a new integrability breaking perturbation through virtual excitations into higher radial modes [27]. In the case considered here where the dynamics are dominated by low momenta particle-hole excitations, virtual excitations involving higher radial modes are suppressed by a high power of momentum [27] and so presumably are subdominant. Nonetheless, it would be valuable to understand the effects of such integrability breaking on dynamics in more general scenarios. We are also interested in applying the formalism developed herein to the problem of thermalization in spin chain materials [8] including rare earth variants [57\textendash 59] placed out of equilibrium and probed by neutron and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering.},

We are able to determine the occupation of individual lattice sites with a fidelity \textbackslash textgreater95\%, enabling direct, local measurement of particle correlations in Fermi lattice systems. This ability will be instrumental for creating and investigating low-temperature phases of the Fermi-Hubbard model, including antiferromagnets and d-wave superfluidity.},

  abstract = {We discuss a phase space representation of quantum dynamics of systems with many degrees of freedom. This representation is based on a perturbative expansion in quantum fluctuations around one of the classical limits. We explicitly analyze expansions around three such limits: (i) corpuscular or Newtonian limit in the coordinate-momentum representation, (ii) wave or Gross-Pitaevskii limit for interacting bosons in the coherent state representation, and (iii) Bloch limit for the spin systems. We discuss both the semiclassical (truncated Wigner) approximation and further quantum corrections appearing in the form of either stochastic quantum jumps along the classical trajectories or the nonlinear response to such jumps. We also discuss how quantum jumps naturally emerge in the analysis of non-equal time correlation functions. This representation of quantum dynamics is closely related to the phase space methods based on the Wigner-Weyl quantization and to the Keldysh technique. We show how such concepts as the Wigner function, Weyl symbol, Moyal product, Bopp operators, and others automatically emerge from the Feynmann's path integral representation of the evolution in the Heisenberg representation. We illustrate the applicability of this expansion with various examples mostly in the context of cold atom systems including sine-Gordon model, one- and two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, Dicke model and others. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Embedding the GGE into the quantum transfer matrix formalism, we develop an iterative procedure to fix the Lagrange multipliers and to calculate predictions for the long-time limit of short-range correlators. The main idea is to consider truncated GGEs with only a finite number of charges and to investigate the convergence of the numerical results as the truncation level is increased. As an example we consider a quantum quench situation where the system is initially prepared in the N\'eel state and then evolves with an XXZ Hamiltonian with anisotropy {$\Delta$} \textbackslash textgreater 1. We provide predictions for short-range correlators and gather numerical evidence that the iterative procedure indeed converges. The results show that the system retains memory of the initial condition, and there are clear differences between the numerical values of the correlators as calculated from the purely thermal and generalized Gibbs ensembles.},

We begin with a review of basic principles of the Lanczos method for computing ground-state static as well as dynamical properties. Next, generalization to finite-temperatures in the form of well established finitetemperature Lanczos method is described. The latter allows for the evaluation of temperatures T {$>$} 0 static and dynamic quantities within various correlated models. Several extensions and modification of the latter method introduced more recently are analysed. In particular, the low-temperature Lanczos method and the microcanonical Lanczos method, especially applicable within the high-T regime. In order to overcome the problems of exponentially growing Hilbert spaces that prevent ED calculations on larger lattices, different approaches based on Lanczos diagonalization within the reduced basis have been developed. In this context, recently developed method based on ED within a limited functional space is reviewed. Finally, we briefly discuss the real-time evolution of correlated systems far from equilibrium, which can be simulated using the ED and Lanczos-based methods, as well as approaches based on the diagonalization in a reduced basis.},

However, a clear relationship between these results has yet to be established. We present a relation between the diffusion constant and the energy-level structure, which leads to the Thouless localization criterion. The latter explains the drift of the crossover/transition to the localized regime with increasing system size. Moreover, we show that the Heisenberg spin chain in the presence of the quasiperiodic fields can be well approached via a sequence of simple periodic systems, where diffusion remains finite even at large fields.},

All local conserved operators follow from the standard (Hermitian) transfer operator in fundamental representation (with auxiliary spin s = 1/2), and are all even with respect to a spin flip operation. However, the quasilocal family is generated by differentiation of a non-Hermitian highest weight transfer operator with respect to a complex auxiliary spin representation parameter s and includes also operators of odd parity. For a finite chain with open boundaries the time derivatives of quasilocal operators are not strictly vanishing but result in operators localized near the boundaries of the chain. We show that a simple modification of the non-Hermitian transfer operator results in exactly conserved, but still quasilocal operators for periodic or generally twisted boundary conditions. As an application, we demonstrate that implementing the new exactly conserved operator family for estimating the high-temperature spin Drude weight results, in the thermodynamic limit, in exactly the same lower bound as for almost conserved family and open boundaries. Under the assumption that the bound is saturating (suggested by agreement with previous thermodynamic Bethe ansatz calculations) we propose a simple explicit construction of infinite time averages of local operators such as the spin current.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the temporal evolution of isolated many-body quantum systems has long been elusive. Recently, meaningful experimental studies of the problem have become possible, stimulating theoretical interest. In generic isolated systems, non-equilibrium dynamics is expected to result in thermalization: a relaxation to states in which the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary, universal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable using statistical mechanics. However, it is not obvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum thermalization possible in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos makes classical thermalization possible. For example, dynamical chaos itself cannot occur in an isolated quantum system, in which the time evolution is linear and the spectrum is discrete. Some recent studies even suggest that statistical mechanics may give incorrect predictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate that a generic isolated quantum many-body system does relax to a state well described by the standard statistical-mechanical prescription. Moreover, we show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation, and that thermalization instead happens at the level of individual eigenstates, as first proposed by Deutsch and Srednicki. A striking consequence of this eigenstate-thermalization scenario, confirmed for our system, is that knowledge of a single many-body eigenstate is sufficient to compute thermal averages-any eigenstate in the microcanonical energy window will do, because they all give the same result. \textcopyright 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

The latter observable exhibits a slower relaxation dynamics in fermionic systems. We identify the origin of this behavior, which is related to the off-diagonal matrix elements of n (k) in the basis of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.

  abstract = {We identify and study classes of initial states in integrable quantum systems that, after the relaxation dynamics following a sudden quench, lead to near-thermal expectation values of few-body observables. In the systems considered here, those states are found to be insulating ground states of lattice hard-core boson Hamiltonians. We show that, as a suitable parameter in the initial Hamiltonian is changed, those states become closer to Fock states (products of single site states) as the outcome of the relaxation dynamics becomes closer to the thermal prediction. At the same time, the energy density approaches a Gaussian. Furthermore, the entropy associated with the generalized canonical and generalized grand-canonical ensembles, introduced to describe observables in integrable systems after relaxation, approaches that of the conventional canonical and grand-canonical ensembles. We argue that those classes of initial states are special because a control parameter allows one to tune the distribution of conserved quantities to approach the one in thermal equilibrium. This helps in understanding the approach of all the quantities studied to their thermal expectation values. However, a finite-size scaling analysis shows that this behavior should not be confused with thermalization as understood for nonintegrable systems. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Physical Society.},

We also investigate whether, following a sudden quench, special classes of pure states can lead to thermal behavior in systems that do not obey ETH, namely, integrable systems. We find examples of this, but only for initial states that obeyed ETH before the quench. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {We investigate finite-size effects in quantum quenches on the basis of simple energetic arguments. Distinguishing between the low-energy part of the excitation spectrum, below a microscopic energy scale, and the high-energy regime enables one to define a crossover number of particles that is shown to diverge in the small quench limit. Another crossover number is proposed based on the fidelity between the initial and final ground states. Both criteria can be computed using ground-state techniques that work for systems larger than full-spectrum diagonalization. As examples, two models are studied: one with free bosons in an harmonic trap whose frequency is quenched and the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model that is known to be nonintegrable and for which recent studies have uncovered remarkable nonequilibrium behaviors. The diagonal weights of the time-averaged density matrix are computed, and observables obtained from this diagonal ensemble are compared with the ones from statistical ensembles. It is argued that the "thermalized" regime of the Bose-Hubbard model, previously observed in the small quench regime, experiences strong finite-size effects that make a thorough comparison with statistical ensembles difficult. In addition, we show that the nonthermalized regime, emerging on finite-size systems and for large interaction quenches, is not related to the existence of an equilibrium quantum critical point but to the high-energy structure of the energy spectrum in the atomic limit. Its features are reminiscent of the quench from the noninteracting limit to the atomic limit. \textcopyright{} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

To achieve good performance, several formats may need to be used in one program, requiring explicit selection and conversion between the formats. This can be both tedious and error-prone, especially for non-expert users. Motivated by this issue, we present a user-friendly sparse matrix class for the C++ language, with a high-level application programming interface deliberately similar to the widely used MATLAB language. The class internally uses two main approaches to achieve efficient execution: (i) a hybrid storage framework, which automatically and seamlessly switches between three underlying storage formats (compressed sparse column, coordinate list, Red-Black tree) depending on which format is best suited for specific operations, and (ii) template-based meta-programming to automatically detect and optimise execution of common expression patterns. To facilitate relatively quick conversion of research code into production environments, the class and its associated functions provide a suite of essential sparse linear algebra functionality (eg., arithmetic operations, submatrix manipulation) as well as high-level functions for sparse eigendecompositions and linear equation solvers. The latter are achieved by providing easy-to-use abstractions of the low-level ARPACK and SuperLU libraries.

The latter breaks integrability and induces a ground-state superfluid to insulator transition. By full exact diagonalization, we study chaos indicators and few-body observables. We show that when different symmetry sectors are mixed, chaos indicators associated with the eigenvectors, contrary to those related to the eigenvalues, capture the onset of chaos. The results for the complexity of the eigenvectors and for the expectation values of few-body observables confirm the validity of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in the chaotic regime, and therefore the occurrence of thermalization. We also study the properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements of few-body observables in relation to the transition from integrability to chaos and from chaos to localization. \textcopyright{} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

Interest has since been growing in the area of quantum computation. One of the main difficulties of quantum computation is that decoherence destroys the information in a superposition of states contained in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. It is shown how to reduce the effects of decoherence for information stored in quantum memory, assuming that the decoherence process acts independently on each of the bits stored in memory. This involves the use of a quantum analog of errorcorrecting codes., This article appears in the following collection:},

The combination of Chebyshev recursion and maximum entropy achieves high-energy resolution without significant roundoff error, machine precision, or numerical instability limitations. If controlled statistical or systematic errors are acceptable, CPU and memory requirements scale linearly in the number of states. The inference of spectral properties from moments is much better conditioned for Chebyshev moments than for power moments. We adapt concepts from the kernel polynomial method, a linear Chebyshev approximation with optimized Gibbs damping, to control the accuracy of Fourier integrals of positive nonanalytic functions.

We present a parameter-free formula for the spin-lattice relaxation rate which is in excellent agreement with experiment.

We also show that this approach is useful to investigate thermalization based on a finite-size scaling of numerical data. The condition follows from an exact representation of the observable as the sum of a projection onto the local conserved charges of the system and a projection onto the nonlocal ones. We show that thermalization requires that the time average of the latter part vanishes in the thermodynamic limit while time and statistical averages for the first part are identical. As an example, we use this thermalization condition to analyze exact diagonalization data for a one-dimensional spin model. We find that local correlators do thermalize in the thermodynamic limit, although we find no indications that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis applies.},

Berry's conjecture is expected to hold only if the corresponding classical system is chaotic, and essentially states that the energy eigenfunctions behave as if they were gaussian random variables. We review the existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially strengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture predicts a Maxwell\textendash Boltzmann, Bose\textendash Einstein, or Fermi\textendash Dirac distribution for the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this phenomenon eigenstate thermalization. We show that a generic initial state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as O(h\textasciimacron/{$\increment$})t-1, where {$\increment$} is the uncertainty in the total energy of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to the classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is needed. We argue that these results constitute a new foundation for quantum statistical mechanics.},

We induce a probability distribution for the expectation values by treating the zero of time as a uniformly distributed random variable. We show explicitly that if an observable has a non-equilibrium expectation value at some particular moment, then it is overwhelmingly likely to move towards equilibrium, both forwards and backwards in time. For deviations from equilibrium that are not much larger than a typical quantum or thermal fluctuation, we find that the time dependence of the move towards equilibrium is given by the Kubo correlation function, in agreement with Onsager's postulate. These results are independent of the details of the system's quantum state.},

  abstract = {With this second volume, we enter the intriguing world of complex analysis. From the first theorems on, the elegance and sweep of the results is evident. The starting point is the simple idea of extending a function initially given for real values of the argument to one that is defined when the argument is complex. From there, one proceeds to the main properties of holomorphic functions, whose proofs are generally short and quite illuminating: the Cauchy theorems, residues, analytic continuation, the argument principle. With this background, the reader is ready to learn a wealth of additional material connecting the subject with other areas of mathematics: the Fourier transform treated by contour integration, the zeta function and the prime number theorem, and an introduction to elliptic functions culminating in their application to combinatorics and number theory. Thoroughly developing a subject with many ramifications, while striking a careful balance between conceptual insights and the technical underpinnings of rigorous analysis, Complex Analysis will be welcomed by students of mathematics, physics, engineering and other sciences. The Princeton Lectures in Analysis represents a sustained effort to introduce the core areas of mathematical analysis while also illustrating the organic unity between them. Numerous examples and applications throughout its four planned volumes, of which Complex Analysis is the second, highlight the far-reaching consequences of certain ideas in analysis to other fields of mathematics and a variety of sciences. Stein and Shakarchi move from an introduction addressing Fourier series and integrals to in-depth considerations of complex analysis; measure and integration theory, and Hilbert spaces; and, finally, further topics such as functional analysis, distributions and elements of probability theory.},

  abstract = {This first volume, a three-part introduction to the subject, is intended for students with a beginning knowledge of mathematical analysis who are motivated to discover the ideas that shape Fourier analysis. It begins with the simple conviction that Fourier arrived at in the early nineteenth century when studying problems in the physical sciences--that an arbitrary function can be written as an infinite sum of the most basic trigonometric functions. The first part implements this idea in terms of notions of convergence and summability of Fourier series, while highlighting applications such as the isoperimetric inequality and equidistribution. The second part deals with the Fourier transform and its applications to classical partial differential equations and the Radon transform; a clear introduction to the subject serves to avoid technical difficulties. The book closes with Fourier theory for finite abelian groups, which is applied to prime numbers in arithmetic progression. In organizing their exposition, the authors have carefully balanced an emphasis on key conceptual insights against the need to provide the technical underpinnings of rigorous analysis. Students of mathematics, physics, engineering and other sciences will find the theory and applications covered in this volume to be of real interest.

In particular, numerical results show a Gaussian relaxation at smallest nonzero momenta which we relate to nonzero stiffness in a grand canonical ensemble.

These chains are the integrable XXZ chain and a nonintegrable modification due to the presence of a staggered magnetic field oriented in the z direction. In the framework of linear response theory, we numerically calculate autocorrelation functions by propagating a single pure state, drawn at random as a typical representative of the full statistical ensemble. By comparing to small-system data from exact diagonalization (ED) and existing short-time data from time-dependent density matrix renormalization group, we show that typicality is satisfied in finite systems over a wide range of temperature and is fulfilled in both integrable and nonintegrable systems. For the integrable case, we calculate the long-time dynamics of the spin current and extract the spin Drude weight for large systems outside the range of ED. We particularly provide strong evidence that the high-temperature Drude weight vanishes at the isotropic point. For the nonintegrable case, we obtain the full relaxation curve of the energy current and determine the heat conductivity as a function of magnetic field, exchange anisotropy, and temperature.},

Interestingly, we observe that the ergodicity breaking transition in systems studied by exact diagonalization (with around 20 lattice sites) takes place at disorder values lower than those reported in previous works. As a consequence, the crossing point in finite systems exhibits nearly thermal properties, i.e., ergodicity indicators at the transition are close to the random matrix theory predictions.},

The subject area is the Bethe-ansatz approach for a number of one-dimensional models, and the setting up of equations within this approach to determine the thermodynamics of these systems. It is a topic that crosses the boundaries between condensed matter physics, mathematics and field theory. The derivation and application of thermodynamic Bethe-ansatz equations for one-dimensional models are explained in detail. This technique is indispensable for physicists studying the low-temperature properties of one-dimensional substances. This book, written by one of the top physicists in this field, and the originator of much of the work in the subject, will be of great interest to theoretical condensed matter physicists.},

The maximum-entropy principle describes which quantum states can be expected in equilibrium, but not how closed quantum many-body systems dynamically equilibrate. Here, we report the experimental observation of the non-equilibrium dynamics of a density wave of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice in the regime of strong correlations. Using an optical superlattice, we follow its dynamics in terms of quasi-local densities, currents and coherences-all showing a fast relaxation towards equilibrium values. Numerical calculations based on matrix-product states are in an excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental data. The system fulfills the promise of being a dynamical quantum simulator, in that the controlled dynamics runs for longer times than present classical algorithms can keep track of. \textcopyright{} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Recent realization of a kinetically constrained chain of Rydberg atoms by Bernien et al., [Nature (London) 551, 579 (2017)] resulted in the observation of unusual revivals in the many-body quantum dynamics. In our previous work [C. J. Turner et al., Nat. Phys. 14, 745 (2018)], such dynamics was attributed to the existence of ``quantum scarred'' eigenstates in the many-body spectrum of the experimentally realized model. Here, we present a detailed study of the eigenstate properties of the same model. We find that the majority of the eigenstates exhibit anomalous thermalization: the observable expectation values converge to their Gibbs ensemble values, but parametrically slower compared to the predictions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Amidst the thermalizing spectrum, we identify nonergodic eigenstates that strongly violate the ETH, whose number grows polynomially with system size. Previously, the same eigenstates were identified via large overlaps with certain product states, and were used to explain the revivals observed in experiment. Here, we find that these eigenstates, in addition to highly atypical expectation values of local observables, also exhibit subthermal entanglement entropy that scales logarithmically with the system size. Moreover, we identify an additional class of quantum scarred eigenstates, and discuss their manifestations in the dynamics starting from initial product states. We use forward scattering approximation to describe the structure and physical properties of quantum scarred eigenstates. Finally, we discuss the stability of quantum scars to various perturbations. We observe that quantum scars remain robust when the introduced perturbation is compatible with the forward scattering approximation. In contrast, the perturbations which most efficiently destroy quantum scars also lead to the restoration of ``canonical'' thermalization.},

  abstract = {The thermodynamic description of many-particle systems rests on the assumption of ergodicity, the ability of a system to explore all allowed configurations in the phase space. Recent studies on many-body localization have revealed the existence of systems that strongly violate ergodicity in the presence of quenched disorder. Here, we demonstrate that ergodicity can be weakly broken by a different mechanism, arising from the presence of special eigenstates in the many-body spectrum that are reminiscent of quantum scars in chaotic non-interacting systems. In the single-particle case, quantum scars correspond to wavefunctions that concentrate in the vicinity of unstable periodic classical trajectories. We show that many-body scars appear in the Fibonacci chain, a model with a constrained local Hilbert space that has recently been experimentally realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator. The quantum scarred eigenstates are embedded throughout the otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum but lead to direct experimental signatures, as we show for periodic recurrences that reproduce those observed in the experiment. Our results suggest that scarred many-body bands give rise to a new universality class of quantum dynamics, opening up opportunities for the creation of novel states with long-lived coherence in systems that are now experimentally realizable.},

  abstract = {The generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) was introduced ten years ago to describe observables in isolated integrable quantum systems after equilibration. Since then, the GGE has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the outcome of the relaxation dynamics of few-body observables in a variety of integrable models, a process we call generalized thermalization. This review discusses several fundamental aspects of the GGE and generalized thermalization in integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which observables equilibrate to the GGE predictions and who should play the role of the bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are the differences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems and in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that the GGE works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite a lot of interest in these questions in recent years, no definite answers have been given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field Ising model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show that the GGE describes spin-spin correlations over the entire system. This makes apparent that there is no need to trace out a part of the system in real space for equilibration to occur and for the GGE to apply. In the past, a spectral decomposition of the weights of various statistical ensembles revealed that generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the XX model (hard-core bosons). Namely, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with similar distributions of conserved quantities have similar expectation values of few-spin observables. Here we show that generalized eigenstate thermalization also occurs in the transverse field Ising model.},

  abstract = {Competition between electron localization and delocalization in Mott insulators underpins the physics of strongly correlated electron systems. Photoexcitation, which redistributes charge, can control this many-body process on the ultrafast 1,2 timescale. So far, time-resolved studies have been carried out in solids in which other degrees of freedom, such as lattice, spin or orbital excitations 3-5 , dominate. However, the underlying quantum dynamics of bareg electronic excitations has remained out of reach. Quantum many-body dynamics are observed only in the controlled environment of optical lattices 6,7 where the dynamics are slower and lattice excitations are absent. By using nearly single-cycle near-infrared pulses, we have measured coherent electronic excitations in the organic salt ET-F 2 TCNQ, a prototypical one-dimensional Mott insulator. After photoexcitation, a new resonance appears, which oscillates at 25THz. Time-dependent simulations of the Mottg Hubbard Hamiltonian reproduce the oscillations, showing that electronic delocalization occurs through quantum interference between bound and ionized holong doublon pairs. \textcopyright{} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, it has been shown that higher-order multi-body interactions could give rise to novel quantum phases with intriguing properties. So far, multi-body interactions have been observed as inelastic loss resonances in three-and four-body recombinations of atom-atom and atom-molecule collisions4-6. Here we demonstrate the presence of effective multi-body interactions7 in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice, emerging through virtual transitions of particles from the lowest energy band to higher energy bands. We observe such interactions up to the six-body case in time-resolved traces of quantum phase revivals8-11, using an atom interferometric technique that allows us to precisely measure the absolute energies of atom number states at a lattice site. In addition, we show that the spectral content of these time traces can reveal the atom number statistics at a lattice site, similar to foundational experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics that yield the statistics of a cavity photon field12. Our precision measurement of multi-body interaction energies provides crucial input for the comparison of optical-lattice quantum simulators with many-body quantum theory. \textcopyright{} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Quantum simulation with ultracold atoms has become a powerful technique to gain insight into interacting many-body systems. In particular, the possibility to study nonequilibrium dynamics offers a unique pathway to understand correlations and excitations in strongly interacting quantum matter. So far, coherent nonequilibrium dynamics has exclusively been observed in ultracold many-body systems of bosonic atoms. Here we report on the observation of coherent quench dynamics of fermionic atoms. A metallic state of ultracold spin-polarized fermions is prepared along with a Bose-Einstein condensate in a shallow three-dimensional optical lattice. After a quench that suppresses tunnelling between lattice sites for both the fermions and the bosons, we observe long-lived coherent oscillations in the fermionic momentum distribution, with a period that is determined solely by the Fermi-Bose interaction energy. Our results show that coherent quench dynamics can serve as a sensitive probe for correlations in delocalized fermionic quantum states and for quantum metrology.},

  abstract = {Throughout physics, stable composite objects are usually formed by way of attractive forces, which allow the constituents to lower their energy by binding together. Repulsive forces separate particles in free space. However, in a structured environment such as a periodic potential and in the absence of dissipation, stable composite objects can exist even for repulsive interactions. Here we report the observation of such an exotic bound state, which comprises a pair of ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical lattice. Consistent with our theoretical analysis, these repulsively bound pairs exhibit long lifetimes, even under conditions when they collide with one another. Signatures of the pairs are also recognized in the characteristic momentum distribution and through spectroscopic measurements. There is no analogue in traditional condensed matter systems of such repulsively bound pairs, owing to the presence of strong decay channels. Our results exemplify the strong correspondence between the optical lattice physics of ultracold bosonic atoms and the Bose-Hubbard model - a link that is vital for future applications of these systems to the study of strongly correlated condensed matter and to quantum information. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract = {This text systematically presents the basics of quantum mechanics, emphasizing the role of Lie groups, Lie algebras, and their unitary representations. The mathematical structure of the subject is brought to the fore, intentionally avoiding significant overlap with material from standard physics courses in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. The level of presentation is attractive to mathematics students looking to learn about both quantum mechanics and representation theory, while also appealing to physics students who would like to know more about the mathematics underlying the subject. This text showcases the numerous differences between typical mathematical and physical treatments of the subject. The latter portions of the book focus on central mathematical objects that occur in the Standard Model of particle physics, underlining the deep and intimate connections between mathematics and the physical world. While an elementary physics course of some kind would be helpful to the reader, no specific background in physics is assumed, making this book accessible to students with a grounding in multivariable calculus and linear algebra. Many exercises are provided to develop the reader's understanding of and facility in quantum-theoretical concepts and calculations.},

We show that a generalized Gibbs ensemble, implemented using all known local conserved charges, fails to reproduce the exact quench-action steady state and to correctly predict postquench equilibrium expectation values of physical observables. This is supported by numerical linked-cluster calculations within the diagonal ensemble in the thermodynamic limit.},

Many counterintuitive non-equilibrium effects have been observed, such as suppressed thermalization in a one-dimensional (1D) gas, the formation of repulsive self-bound dimers, and identical behaviours for attractive and repulsive interactions. Here, we observe the expansion of a bundle of ultracold 1D Bose gases in a flat-bottomed optical lattice potential. By combining in situ measurements with photoassociation, we follow the spatial dynamics of singly, doubly and triply occupied lattice sites. The system sheds interaction energy by dissolving some doublons and triplons. Some singlons quantum distil out of the doublon centre, whereas others remain confined. Our Gutzwiller mean-field model captures these experimental features in a physically clear way. These experiments might be used to study thermalization in systems with particle losses, the evolution of quantum entanglement or, if applied to fermions, to prepare very low entropy states.},
