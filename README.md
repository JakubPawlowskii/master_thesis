# Eigenmodes in nearly integrable quantum chains
This is a repository for my Master's Thesis, written undert he supervision of prof. Marcin Mierzejewski during my Big Data Analytics degree at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. The purpose of this thesis is the
review of Krylov space methods and the investigation of quasiballistic spin transport in longa-range, anisotropic Heisenberg model.
