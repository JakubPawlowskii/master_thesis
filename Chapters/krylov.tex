The main purpose of this thesis is to develop and test a set of numerical tools based on the Lanczos algorithm,
which is an iterative method for finding extremal eigenvalues of a large matrix. In its simplest form, it is
useful for efficient calculation of a ground state energy and eigenvector, and subsequently for determining
the ground state properties of a system of choice. However, in this work we are mainly interested in infinite
temperature properties, which requires sampling of the whole spectrum of Hamiltonian in question.
