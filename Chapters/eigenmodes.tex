\chapter{Slowly decaying eigenmodes\label{chap:currents}}
\thispagestyle{chapterBeginStyle}

In the previous chapter, we numerically showed the existence of optimal anisotropy
\(\Delta_{\mathrm{O}} = \exp(- \alpha + 2)\), which ensures slow relaxation of the spin current
\(j^{\sigma}\)~\eqref{eq:spin_current} and consequently quasiballistic spin transport.
Here, we are going to demonstrate that this feature is not unique to the spin current, but
exhibited also by a class of other, \textit{local} operators. To this end, we will
employ an algorithm devised by \textcite{Mierzejewski2015a}, originally designed to
identify local integrals of motion in integrable tight-binding models.
The long-range anisotropic Heisenberg model that we consider in this work is not integrable,
thus we are not expecting to find strictly conserved quantities,
but only so-called \textbf{local slowly relaxing operators (LSROs)}.
We will interpret the discovered observables in terms of
fermionic currents, describing particle hopping with various ranges.
Moreover, we will also show how to improve the numerical efficiency of
the algorithm, by utilizing symmetry subspaces and the Dynamical Quantum Typicality
approach to correlation functions\footnote{And why it, unfortunately, fails in this case.}
(cf. section~\ref{sec:DQT}). We stress once again that the results presented in this
chapter were originally obtained by the author of this thesis.

\section{Detecting local slowly relaxing operators \label{sec:slowly_relaxing_operators}}
\subsection{Theoretical description}
Let us start by introducing in detail the original algorithm for detecting local integrals
of motion (LIOMs), following the original article by~\textcite{Mierzejewski2015a}.
In principle, finding a \textbf{complete set of LIOMs} is a conceptually
nontrivial task, however, this procedure reduces it to a simple application of linear algebra~\autocite{Mierzejewski2015a}.
In this section, unless stated otherwise, by \(\hat{H} \) we will denote an arbitrary
tight-binding Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions
on \(L\) sites, having eigenstates \(\hat{H}  \ket{n} = E_{n} \ket{n}\). Moreover,
for any operator \(A\) we define \(A_{mn} \equiv \matrixel{m}{A}{n}\).

In order to employ techniques from linear algebra, we need to have a linear space of some kind.
This role is played by the space of \textit{local, traceless, and translationally invariant} observables,
supported on up to \(M\) sites and acting on vectors from a Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\) of
dimension \(\mathcal{D}\). We will denote this space by \(\mathcal{V}_{M}\). Its building blocks are the
spaces \(\mathcal{V}^m\), of operators supported on exactly \(m\) sites, i.e. of the form

where blue circles correspond to single-site identity operators, green circles to an arbitrary
single-site operator except for the identity and red circles to an arbitrary single-site operator.
If we were to allow identity operators on green sites, we would have obtained a \((m-1)\)-local operator.
It is easy to see that an arbitrary linear combination of operators from \(\mathcal{V}^m\) is again
an element of \(\mathcal{V}^m\), hence \(\mathcal{V}^m\) is a linear space. Therefore,
the full space
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{V}_{M} = \bigoplus_{m=1}^{M} \mathcal{V}^m
\end{equation}
is also a linear space. We will always assume that \(0\leq M \leq L/2\).

Using the infinite temperature correlation function (cf. Eq.~\eqref{eq:corr_fun}) we can endow this space with an inner product
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{V}_M \cross \mathcal{V}_M \ni (A, B) \mapsto \hs{A}{B}
  \equiv \frac{1}{\mathcal{D}}\Tr\left(A^{\dagger} B\right) = \frac{1}{D}\sum_{n,m = 1}^{D} A_{nm}^{\ast} B_{nm} \in \CC
  \label{eq:hs_prod}
\end{equation}
called the \textbf{Hilbert-Schmidt inner product} and
inducing the \textbf{Hilbert-Schmidt norm} \(\norm{A} = \sqrt{\hs{A}{A}}\).
Because we only consider finite systems in this thesis, we do not need to worry about
situations where the trace is not well defined. The pair \( (\mathcal{V}_M, \hs{\cdot}{\cdot}) \)
is then a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.
We are now able to state more precisely what we mean by a complete set of LIOMs.
It is a set of local observables \(\{Q_{\beta} : \comm{Q_{\beta}}{\hat{H} } = 0\}\), such that
for any observable \(A\) we have
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{t\to\infty} \hs{A(t)}{A} = \sum_{\beta} \frac{\hs{Q_{\beta}}{A}^2}{\hs{Q_{\beta}}{Q_{\beta}}}
\end{equation}
i.e. the completeness is understood as the saturation of the Mazur bound~\autocite{Mazur1969}.

The mathematical stage is now set, so let us proceed further toward the algorithm.
As \(\mathcal{V}_M\) is a linear space, it possesses a basis \(\{O_{\gamma}\}\),
which with the help of the inner product can be made into an orthonormal basis \(\hs{O_{\gamma}}{O_{\gamma^{\prime}}} = \delta_{\gamma\gamma^{\prime}}\).
We can also think of this space as an orthogonal subspace of the space \(\mathcal{V}\) of all possible operators
acting on \(\mathcal{H}\), in the sense that
\begin{equation}
  \big(\forall A \in \mathcal{V} \big) \big( A = A^M + A^{\perp} = \sum_{\gamma} \hs{O_{\gamma}}{A} O_{\gamma} + A^{\perp}\big) ,
  \text{ such that } \big(\forall \gamma\big) \big( ({O_{\gamma}}|{A^{\perp}}) = 0\big)
  \label{eq:decomposition}
\end{equation}
We will describe an example of such a basis in the next section, but for now, it is enough that it exists.
Next, we would like to determine the conserved part of all the basis operators \(O_{\gamma}\). We do this
by considering the infinite time average
\begin{align}
  \bar{O}_{\gamma} = \lim_{\tau\to\infty}\frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^{\tau} O_{\gamma}(t) \dd{t} & =
  \lim_{\tau\to\infty}\frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^{\tau} \mathrm{e}^{i \hat{H}  t}O_{\gamma} \mathrm{e}^{-i \hat{H}  t} \dd{t} \nonumber                                                                                                   \\
                                                                                           & = \sum_{m,n} (O_{\gamma})_{mn}\ketbra{m}{n} \lim_{\tau\to\infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^{\tau} \mathrm{e}^{i(E_m-E_n)t} \dd{t} \nonumber \\
                                                                                           & = \sum_{\substack{n,m                                                                                                                   \\ E_n = E_m}} (O_{\gamma})_{mn}\ketbra{m}{n}
  \label{eq:time_avg}
\end{align}
This time-averaging amounts to a cut-off, removing all matrix elements between non-degenerate eigenstates
of the Hamiltonian. A crucial property of this operation is that it is an orthogonal projection
in the space of operators, i.e. \(\hs{\bar{O}_{\gamma}}{\bar{O}_{\gamma^{\prime}}} = \hs{\bar{O}_{\gamma}}{O_{\gamma^{\prime}}}\). This will
in the end allow us to distinguish between different types of conserved quantities.
However, our ultimate goal concerns LSROs in a system that is not integrable, which dictates the
need for performing also a finite-time averaging. Unfortunately, a simple omission of the limit
in Eq.~\eqref{eq:time_avg} destroys the projective character of this operation. To remedy this,
we introduce a parameter \(\tau\) and define effective time averaging~\autocite{Mierzejewski2015}
as
\begin{equation}
  \bar{O}_{\gamma}^{\tau} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} O_{\gamma}(t) \frac{\sin(t/\tau)}{\pi t} \dd{t}
  \label{eq:finite_time_avg_integral}
\end{equation}
By considering the Fourier transform of the \(\sin(x)/x\) function, it can be shown that
this expression is equivalent to (see Appendix~\ref{app:fourier} for details)
\begin{equation}
  \bar{O}_{\gamma}^{\tau} = \sum_{n,m} \underbrace{\theta\left(\frac{1}{\tau} - |E_n - E_m|\right)}_{\theta_{nm}^{\tau}} (O_{\gamma})_{mn} \ketbra{m}{n}
  \label{eq:finite_time_avg}
\end{equation}
and because for Heaviside \(\theta \)-function we have \(\theta(x)^2 = \theta(x)\), the projective character is restored.
Properties of the \(\theta\)-function ensure that the \(\tau\to\infty\) limit of Eq.~\eqref{eq:finite_time_avg}
agrees with Eq.~\eqref{eq:time_avg}. Notice also the similarity of this expression to the integrated conductivity~\eqref{eq:integrated_conductivity}.
Indeed, the parameter \(1/\tau\) can be interpreted as \(\Omega\), giving the frequency cut-off for the matrix elements.
Thus, for finite \(\tau\), \(\hs{\bar{O}_{\gamma}^{\tau}}{\bar{O}_{\gamma^{\prime}}^{\tau}}\) can be related to the low-frequency spectrum of
the correlation function \(\langle O_{\gamma}(t) O_{\gamma^{\prime}} \rangle\). We shall return to this idea later on.

Let us now calculate the commutator of \(O_{\gamma}^{\tau}\) with the Hamiltonian
\begin{align}
  \comm{\hat{H} }{\bar{O}_{\gamma}^{\tau}} & = \sum_n \sum_{k,p} E_n \theta_{kp}^{\tau} (\bar{O}_{\gamma})_{kp} \comm{ \ketbra{n}{n}}{ \ketbra{k}{p}} \nonumber         \\
                                           & = \sum_{k,p} \left(E_k-E_p\right) \theta_{kp}^{\tau} (\bar{O}_{\gamma})_{kp} \ketbra{k}{p} \xrightarrow{\tau \to \infty} 0
  \label{eq:time_averaged_commutator}
\end{align}
We see that the operator obtained from infinite-time averaging is an integral of motion. Unfortunately,
this procedure modifies the support of the operator and in general \(\bar{O}_{\gamma} \not\in \mathcal{V}_M\), i.e. its locality is lost.

Having calculated the time-averaged basis \( \{\bar{O}_{\gamma}^{\tau}\} \), we would like to perform in a
systematic way the decomposition~\ref{eq:decomposition}. We need the overlaps between the basis operators
before and after the time-averaging. Because of the projective character of the time-averaging, they are
given by the pairwise inner products of the time-averaged operators, which we collect into a matrix
\(K^{\tau}\), with elements
\begin{equation}
  K^{\tau}_{\gamma\gamma^{\prime}} = \hs{\bar{O}_{\gamma}^{\tau}}{\bar{O}_{\gamma^{\prime}}^{\tau}} = \frac{1}{\mathcal{D}}\sum_{n,m} \theta_{nm}^{\tau} (O_{\gamma})_{nm} (O_{\gamma^{\prime}})_{nm}^{\ast}
  \label{eq:overlap_matrix}
\end{equation}
This matrix is Hermitian by design, and in the case of systems with time-reversal symmetry, it is also real,
thus symmetric. By the spectral theorem, there exists a unitary matrix \(U^{\tau}\) that transforms it
via a similarity transformation to a diagonal matrix \(D^{\tau}\)
\begin{align}
   & \sum_{\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}} U^{\tau}_{\beta \gamma} K_{\gamma\gamma^{\prime}}^{\tau} {(U^{\tau})}_{\beta^{\prime} \gamma^{\prime}}^{\ast}=\delta_{\beta\beta^{\prime}} \lambda^{\tau}_{\beta} \in
  \RR,\;\;\; \lambda_{\beta}^{\tau } \text{ --- eigenvalue of }K^{\tau} \label{eq:property diag}                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\
   & U^{\tau}{(U^{\tau})}^{\dag} = {(U^{\tau})}^{\dag}U^{\tau} = \mathbb{1} \implies \sum_{\gamma} {(U^{\tau})}_{\beta\gamma}(U^{\tau})_{\beta^{\prime}\gamma}^{\ast} =
  \delta_{\beta\beta^{\prime}} \label{eq:propery_ortho}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\
   & U^{\tau} K^{\tau} = D^{\tau} U^{\tau} \implies \sum_{\gamma} U^{\tau}_{\beta\gamma} K_{\gamma\gamma^{\prime}}^{\tau} = \sum_{\gamma}  \delta_{\beta\gamma} \lambda^{\tau}_{\gamma} U^{\tau}_{\gamma\gamma^{\prime}} = \lambda^{\tau}_{\beta} U^{\tau}_{\beta\gamma^{\prime}}\label{eq:property}
\end{align}
Using the columns of \(U^{\tau}\), which are just the eigenvectors of \(K^{\tau}\), we can construct a new set of operators
\begin{equation}
  Q_{\beta} = \sum_{\gamma} U^{\tau}_{\beta \gamma} O_{\gamma}
  \label{eq:liom}
\end{equation}
Let us note a few properties of the newly defined quantities. First, they are orthonormal
and become \textit{orthogonal} after the finite-time averaging with cutoff \(\tau\)
\begin{align}
  \hs{\bar{Q} ^{\tau}_\beta}{\bar{Q} ^{\tau}_{\beta^{\prime}}} & = \sum_{\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}} U^{\tau}_{\beta\gamma} {\hs{\bar{O}_{\gamma}^{\tau}}{\bar{O}_{\gamma^{\prime}}^{\tau}}} (U^{\tau})_{\beta^{\prime}\gamma^{\prime}}^{\ast}
  = \sum_{\gamma^{\prime}} \left(\sum_{\gamma}U^{\tau}_{\beta\gamma} K_{\gamma\gamma^{\prime}}^{\tau}\right)  (U^{\tau})_{\beta^{\prime}{\gamma^{\prime}}}^{\ast}\nonumber                                                                               \\
                                                               & = \lambda^{\tau}_{\beta} \sum_{\gamma^{\prime}} U^{\tau}_{\beta\gamma^{\prime}} (U^{\tau})_{\beta^{\prime}\gamma^{\prime}}^{\ast} = \lambda^{\tau}_{\beta} \delta_{\beta\beta^{\prime}}
\end{align}
where the last two equalities follow from~\eqref{eq:property} and~\eqref{eq:propery_ortho} respectively.
For \(\beta =\beta ^{\prime} \), the quantity \(\lambda^{\tau}_{\beta}\) is called the \textbf{finite-time stiffness} of the operator \(Q_{\beta}\).
From the fact that \(\hs{\bar{Q}^{\tau}_{\beta}}{\bar{Q}^{\tau}_{\beta}} = \lambda^{\tau}_{\beta}\) and that \(\hs{\cdot}{\cdot}\) is an inner product,
we immediately deduce that \(K^{\tau}\) is positive semidefinite.
We are now ready to consider the desired decomposition into the part that is supported on at most \(M\) sites and the remaining, nonlocal part
\begin{align}
  \bar{Q}^{\tau}_{\beta} & =  \sum_{\gamma} \hs{O_{\gamma}}{\bar{Q} ^{\tau}_{\beta}}O_{\gamma} + (\bar{Q} ^{\tau}_{\beta})^{\perp} = \sum_{\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}} U^{\tau}_{\beta \gamma^{\prime}}\hs{O_{\gamma}}{\bar{O}_{\gamma^{\prime}}^{\tau}}
  O_{\gamma}+(\bar{Q} ^{\tau}_{\beta})^{\perp} \nonumber                                                                                                                                                                                             \\
                         & = \sum_{\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}} U^{\tau}_{\beta\gamma^{\prime}}\hs{\bar{O}_{\gamma}^{\tau}}{\bar{O}_{\gamma^{\prime}}^{\tau}} O_{\gamma}+(\bar{Q} ^{\tau}_{\beta})^{\perp}
  = \sum_{\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}} U^{\tau}_{\beta\gamma^{\prime}}K^{\tau}_{\gamma\gamma^{\prime}} O_{\gamma}+(\bar{Q} ^{\tau}_{\beta})^{\perp} \nonumber                                                                                             \\
                         & = \sum_{\gamma}  \left( \sum_{\gamma^{\prime}} U^{\tau}_{\beta\gamma^{\prime}}K_{\gamma\gamma^{\prime}}^{\tau}\right) O_{\gamma}+(\bar{Q} ^{\tau}_{\beta})^{\perp} = \sum_{\gamma}
  \lambda^{\tau}_{\beta} U^{\tau}_{\beta \gamma} O_{\gamma}+(\bar{Q} ^{\tau}_{\beta})^{\perp} = \underbrace{(\bar{Q}^{\tau}_{\beta})^{M}}_{\lambda_{\beta }^{\tau } Q_{\beta }}+(\bar{Q} ^{\tau}_{\beta})^{\perp}
  \label{eq:decomposition2}
\end{align}
We see that the \(M\)-local part after the time averaging is just the operator \(Q_{\beta}\) multiplied by the finite-time stiffness \(\lambda_{\beta}^{\tau}\).

Everything we did so far holds for an
arbitrary value of \(\tau\). However, let us for a moment restrict it to \(\tau\to \infty\), dropping the superscript.
This guarantees that the operators \(\bar{Q} _{\beta}\) are integrals of motion.
We have one step left to complete the algorithm and obtain a classification scheme.
We need to determine how much of the operator \(\bar{Q} _{\beta }\) is contained in the
\(M\)-local part \(\bar{Q} _{\beta}^M\). In other words, we want to calculate \(\norm*{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\perp}}\).
Consider the following form of the \textbf{infinite-time stiffness} 
\begin{align}
  \lambda_{\beta} & = \hs{\bar{Q} _{\beta}}{\bar{Q} _{\beta}} = \hs{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^M + \bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\perp}}{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^M + \bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\perp}} = \hs{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^M}{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^M} +
  \hs{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\perp}}{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\perp}} + \underbrace{2 \hs{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^M}{\bar{Q}_{\beta}^{\perp}}}_{=0} \nonumber                                                                        \\
                  & = \hs{\sum_{\gamma} \lambda_{\beta} U_{\beta\gamma} O_{\gamma}}{\sum_{\gamma^{\prime}} \lambda_{\beta} U_{\beta\gamma^{\prime}} O_{\gamma^{\prime}}} + \norm{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\perp}}^2 =
  \lambda_{\beta}^2 \sum_{\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}} U_{\beta\gamma} \hs{O_{\gamma}}{O_{\gamma^{\prime}}} U_{\beta\gamma^{\prime}}^{\ast} + \norm{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\perp}}^2  \nonumber                             \\
                  & =\lambda_{\beta}^2 + \norm{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\perp}}^2
\end{align}
Rearranging the terms, we obtain the desired formula
\begin{equation}
  \norm{\bar{Q}_{\beta}^{\perp}}^2 = \lambda_{\beta}^2 - \lambda_{\beta} = \lambda_{\beta} (\lambda_{\beta} - 1) \geq 0
  \label{eq:liom_norm}
\end{equation}
Thus, the spectrum of the matrix \(K\) is contained in the interval \([0,1]\) and
determines the classification of the integrals of motion. We have three classes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item local: \(\lambda_{\beta} = 1 \implies \norm{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\perp}} = 0 \implies \bar{Q}_{\beta} \in \mathcal{V}_M\)
  \item quasilocal: \(\lambda_{\beta} \in \left(0,1\right) \implies \norm{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\perp}} > 0 \implies \bar{Q} _{\beta} \in \mathcal{V} \)
  \item generic nonlocal: \(\lambda_{\beta} = 0 \implies \norm{\bar{Q} _{\beta}} = 0\)
\end{itemize}
Let us now give a physical interpretation of these results. The procedure outlined above
can be carried out for, in principle, arbitrary but finite systems size \(L\). However,
to understand the character of the integrals of motion, we need to take the thermodynamic
limit \(L\to\infty\). In practical calculations, we are always limited to finite, \(M\)-local basis
of operators. Thus, the output of the algorithm is not the set of true integrals of motion \(\{\bar{Q}_{\beta}\}\),
but rather the set \(\{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^M / \lambda_{\beta} \}=\{Q_{\beta}\}\) (as eigenvectors obtained from numerical
procedures are usually normalized). If a particular \(\lambda_{\beta} = 1\), this
is not a problem, as we have \(\norm*{\bar{Q}^M_{\beta}} = 1\), and the integral of motion is \(M\)-local.
However, if for a given \({\beta}\) we have \(0 < \lambda_{\beta} < 1\), then \(\norm*{\bar{Q} ^M_{\beta}} < 1\).
It is only if this norm stays non-zero in the thermodynamic limit, we can say that the operator is
quasilocal. Then \(\bar{Q} _{\beta}^M\)
can be regarded as an \(M\)-local approximation of the true integral of motion \(\bar{Q} _{\beta}\), which
extends beyond just \(M\) sites. 
Numerous studies have confirmed their relevance in the theory of integrable
systems~\autocite{Ilievski2015, Ilievski2015a, Prosen2013, Prosen2014},
however, we shall not deal with them any further. In fact, we shall not even deal with LIOMs, as
the system we are interested in here is not integrable. Nevertheless, even without integrability,
this algorithm will produce a sequence of operators \(\{Q_{\beta}\}\), with the largest possible
infinite-time stiffness. We will refer to them as \textbf{local slowly relaxing operators (LSROs)}
and they will play a central role in section~\ref{sec:fermionic_currents}. 

Let us pause for a moment and relax the constraint \(\tau \to \infty \),
so as to see another interpretation of the eigenvalues of \(K^{\tau}\), or equivalently,
of the finite-time stiffnesses of operatora \(Q_{\beta }\) 
\begin{align}
  \lambda^{\tau}_{\beta} & = \hs{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\tau}}{\bar{Q} _{\beta}^{\tau}} = \sum_{\gamma\gamma^{\prime}}

  \underbrace{\left[\sum_{\gamma^{\prime}}{U}^{\ast}_{\beta\gamma^{\prime}} (O_{\gamma^{\prime}})_{mn}\right]}_{\left(Q_{\beta}\right)^{\ast}_{mn}}

\end{align}
It is the so-called \textbf{integrated spectral function}~\autocite{Vidmar2021} of the operator \(Q_{\beta}\) at frequency \(\Omega = 1/\tau\).
Thus, by investigating the eigenvalues of \(K^{\tau}\) we can study our LSROs on the same footing as the integrated
conductivity~\eqref{eq:integrated_conductivity} in the previous chapter. This suggests an extended classification of operators, based on their
spectral properties, precisely on the structure of matrix elements \(\left(Q_{\beta}\right)_{nm}\). It is succinctly
summarized in figure~\ref{fig:types_of_ops}.

\subsection{Details of implementation}

Before proceeding further toward a concrete application of the procedure outlined above, let us first discuss
some technical details of its implementation. The most demanding part, from the computational point of view,
is the calculation of matrix elements~\eqref{eq:overlap_matrix}. It requires explicit construction of
matrices of all the basis operators \(O_{\gamma}\), change of basis using Hamiltonian eigenstates,
time averaging~\eqref{eq:finite_time_avg}, and finally carrying out the trace of pairwise products.
All those operations are constrained by the fact that the Hilbert space dimension grows exponentially.
To keep the computational cost manageable, we can use symmetries of the system. In chapter~\ref{chap:intro}, we
have explored how the presence of symmetry, manifested by the existence of an operator \(S\), such
that \(\comm{S}{\hat{H} } = 0\), can be used to decompose the Hilbert space into a direct sum of \(s_{\text{max}}\) smaller
subspaces \(\mathcal{H}_{s}\), consisting of states with a fixed eigenvalue \(s\) of \(S\). Given a
compatible operator \(A\), its matrix in the symmetry-adapted basis has a block-diagonal structure.
It is easy to see that then, its trace is equal to the sum of traces of the individual blocks.
Thus, instead of carrying out the algorithm in the full Hilbert space, we can perform it separately
in each symmetry sector and then construct the matrix \(K^{\tau}\) by summing the matrices of the
individual sectors. However, there is a caveat. We require the basis operators \(O_{\gamma}\) to be
traceless, to avoid trivial overlaps with the identity operator, and normalized, to form an orthonormal
basis. But they must be traceless and normalized with respect to the full space Hilbert-Schmidt inner
product~\eqref{eq:hs_prod}, not the one restricted to a symmetry sector. It is known from linear algebra,
that given a collection of spaces equipped with an inner product, a unique way to define an inner product
on the direct sum of those spaces is to consider the sum of the individual inner products~\autocite{Conway2007}.
Thus, we have the following identities
\begin{align}
  \Lambda_A & \equiv \frac{1}{\mathcal{D}} \Tr(A) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{D}} \sum_{s=1}^{s_{\text{max}}} \Tr(A^s)                                  \\
  \Gamma_A^2  & \equiv \norm{A}^2 = \frac{1}{\mathcal{D}} \Tr(A^{\dag}A) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{D}} \sum_{s=1}^{s_{\text{max}}} \Tr((A^s)^{\dag}A^s)
\end{align}
where by \(A^s\) we denote the block of matrix of \(A\) in the symmetry sector with eigenvalue \(s\).
Now, we are ready to derive the formula for the overlap matrix, using symmetry sectors. For brevity,
we shall suppress the \(\tau\) superscript.
\begin{align}
  K_{\gamma\gamma^{\prime}} & = \hs{\frac{\bar{O}_{\gamma} - \Lambda_{O_{\gamma}}}{\Gamma_{O_{\gamma}}}}{\frac{\bar{O}_{\gamma^{\prime}} - \Lambda_{O_{\gamma^{\prime}}}}{\Gamma_{O_{\gamma^{\prime}}}}}
  = \frac{1}{\mathcal{D}} \Tr\left(\frac{\bar{O}_{\gamma} - \Lambda_{O_{\gamma}}}{\Gamma_{O_{\gamma}}}\frac{\bar{O}_{\gamma^{\prime}} - \Lambda_{O_{\gamma^{\prime}}}}{\Gamma_{O_{\gamma^{\prime}}}}\right) \nonumber                                                                                                         \\
                            & = \frac{1}{\mathcal{D} \Gamma_{O_{\gamma}}\Gamma_{O_{\gamma^{\prime}}}} \left[\Tr(\bar{O}_{\gamma} \bar{O}_{\gamma^{\prime}}) - \Lambda_{\gamma^{\prime}} \Tr(O_{\gamma}) - \Lambda_{\gamma} \Tr(O_{\gamma^{\prime}}) + \Lambda_{\gamma} \Lambda_{\gamma^{\prime}} \mathcal{D} \right]\nonumber \\
                            & = \frac{1}{\mathcal{D} \Gamma_{O_{\gamma}}\Gamma_{O_{\gamma^{\prime}}}} \left[\Tr(\bar{O}_{\gamma} \bar{O}_{\gamma^{\prime}}) - \Lambda_{\gamma^{\prime}} \Lambda_{\gamma} \mathcal{D} \right] \nonumber                                                                                        \\
                            & = \frac{1}{\mathcal{D} \Gamma_{O_{\gamma}}\Gamma_{O_{\gamma^{\prime}}}} \left[\sum_{s=1}^{s_{\text{max}}} \Tr(\bar{O}_{\gamma}^s \bar{O}_{\gamma^{\prime}}^s) - \Lambda_{\gamma^{\prime}} \Lambda_{\gamma} \mathcal{D} \right]
\end{align}

\end{algorithm}

There is one more possible improvement to the algorithm. We have spent the better part of chapter~\ref{chap:krylov}
developing numerical methods that allow us to avoid using Exact Diagonalization. However, the algorithm presented
above requires knowledge of the full eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian. It turns out, that it is possible
to escape this requirement, and instead rely on the Dynamical Quantum Typicality approach to correlation functions.
We have already hinted at that relationship after introducing finite time averaging~\eqref{eq:finite_time_avg}.
To see this, let us calculate the Fourier transform of an infinite-temperature correlation function between
two operators \(A\) and \(B\). It is a bit lengthy to carry out the calculation in a rigorous way, so the
details are relegated to Appendix~\ref{app:fourier}. The result, written in spectral representation, is
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}\left[\hs{A(t)}{B}\right] = \frac{1}{\dimension}\sum_{n,m} A_{mn} B_{nm} \delta(E_m-E_n+\omega)
  \label{eq:fourier_corr}
\end{equation}
Let us now do one more step and consider the integral of \(\mathcal{F}\left[\hs{A(t)}{B}\right]\) over
some finite frequency window \([-\Omega, \Omega]\), akin to the integrated conductivity~\eqref{eq:integrated_conductivity}.
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{I}_{AB}(\Omega) & = \int_{-\Omega}^{\Omega} \mathcal{F}\left[\hs{A(t)}{B}\right](\omega) \dd{\omega } =
  \frac{1}{\dimension}\sum_{n,m} A_{mn} B_{nm} \int_{-\Omega}^{\Omega}
  \delta(E_m-E_n+\omega)\dd{\omega }  \nonumber                                                                    \\ &= \frac{1}{\dimension}\sum_{n,m} A_{mn} B_{nm}
  \theta(\Omega + (E_m-E_n))\theta(\Omega - (E_m-E_n)) \nonumber                                                   \\
                           & = \frac{1}{\dimension}\sum_{n,m} A_{mn} B_{nm}\theta(\Omega - \abs{E_m-E_n})
  \label{eq:integrated_spectral}
\end{align}
This is a very important result, as it gives us another way to calculate the integrated spectral function \(\mathcal{I}_{AB}(\Omega)\).
Moreover, it tells us that the matrix element of the overlap matrix \(K^{\tau}\),
for a pair of operators \(A\) and \(B\), is equal to the integrated Fourier transform of the infinite-temperature
correlation function between \(A\) and \(B\). This means that we can calculate the matrix elements of \(K^{\tau}\)
by using the Dynamical Quantum Typicality and Lanczos-based approach, which should be more efficient than Exact Diagonalization.
Unfortunately, this is not the case for the physical system considered in this thesis,
i.e. the long-range Heisenberg model. The reason is that the efficiency of Lanczos-based
correlation function calculation relies on the sparse structure of the Hamiltonian matrix.
This is of course not the case for a power-law decaying interaction. Thus, we will not use this approach
here, as its performance is worse than Exact Diagonalization. However, all the work is not in vain, as this method will surely prove useful
for further research.


\section{Fermionic currents in the long-range Heisenberg model \label{sec:fermionic_currents}}

We are now ready to apply the algorithm described in the previous section to the long-range Heisenberg model.
Let us stress again, that this model is not integrable, thus we do not expect to find any
strictly conserved, local operator, i.e. LIOMs \(\bar{Q}_{\beta}\) with \(\lambda_{\beta} = 1\).
Nevertheless, we can still hope to find a sequence of operators with large stiffness,
indicating their slow relaxation.

In order to use the procedure, we need to construct a basis of the operator space \(\mathcal{V}_M\).
Our starting point is a set of traceless, translationally invariant operators \(\{O^{\prime}_{\gamma}\}\),
\begin{equation}
  O^{\prime}_{\gamma} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L}}\sum_{\ell=1}^L\left( o_{\ell+1}o_{\ell+2}\ldots o_{\ell+M} \right)
  \label{eq:operator_basis}
\end{equation}
where \(o_{\ell} \in \{\Id_{\ell}, \sqrt{2}\Sm_{\ell},\sqrt{2}\Sp_{\ell},2\Sz_{\ell}\}\) are the single-site operators.
It can be verified by direct calculation that they are orthonormal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product,
as required. However, they are not Hermitian. We have two possible ways to remedy this. First, is
to consider \textbf{real operators} of the form \(O_{\gamma} = (O^{\prime}_{\gamma} + O^{\prime}_{\gamma}{}^{\dag})\).
The Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:long_range} is an example of a real operator. The second option is to consider \textbf{imaginary operators},
defined as \(O_{\gamma} = i(O^{\prime}_{\gamma} - O^{\prime}_{\gamma}{}^{\dag})\). The spin current~\eqref{eq:spin_current}
belongs to this class. Fortunately, operators belonging to different classes are orthogonal, so we can
consider them separately. Here, we are seeking the most conserved operators, sharing some properties with
the spin current, so we are going to focus on the imaginary operators. We numerically perform the steps
described in Algorithm~\ref{alg:liom_alg}, initially for \(\tau\to\infty\), using the basis of imaginary operators \(\{O_{\gamma}\}\)
and the Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:long_range} and obtain a sequence of local, orthonormal observables
\(Q_{\beta} = \sum_{\gamma} U_{\beta\gamma} O_{\gamma}\) together with corresponding stifnesses \(\lambda_{\beta}\).
Figure~\ref{fig:stiffness} shows the dependence of the stiffness of the top 3 operators, on the parameters \(\Delta\) and \(\gamma\).
These results were obtained for a system of \(L=16\) sites, with a maximal operator support of \(M=4\) using full Hilbert space.
We see that \(\lambda_2\) and \(\lambda_3\) exhibit behavior resembling the initially investigated spin current,
that is a clear maximum along the line of optimal anisotropy \(\Delta_{\mathrm{O}}(\alpha) = \exp(-\alpha + 2)\),
whereas \(\lambda_1\) is approximately constant above this line and sharply drops below it.
As we are not aware of any mechanism explaining non-zero stiffness in the thermodynamic limit, we
have also carried out a finite-size analysis of operators \(Q_2\) and \(Q_3\) for 3 points in the parameter space:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/stiffness.jpg}
  \caption{Heatmaps depicting the dependence of the stiffness of the top 3 operators on the parameters \(\Delta\) and \(\gamma\).
    From left to right we have \(\lambda_1\), \(\lambda_2\) and \(\lambda_3\) respectively. The black line corresponds
    to the optimal anisotropy \(\Delta_{\mathrm{O} }(\alpha) = \exp(-\alpha + 2)\).}
  \label{fig:stiffness}
\end{figure}
\noindent below the optimal line \((\alpha,\Delta) = (3.5,0.0)\), on the optimal line \((\alpha,\Delta) = (3.5,0.2)\) and
above the optimal line \((\alpha,\Delta) = (3.5,0.8)\). The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stiffness_finite_size}.
We observe another feature manifesting itself along the line of optimal anisotropy. Not only
the stiffness is the largest, but its dependence on the system size is also the weakest. Still,
we know of no reason for it to stay finite in the thermodynamic limit, so we expect it to
decay for systems much beyond our reach.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/finite_size.pdf}
  \caption{Finite size dependence of \(\lambda_2\) (left panel) and \(\lambda_3\) (right panel) for the
    optimal anisotropy \(\alpha = 3.5\), \(\Delta = 0.2\) and away from it (\(\Delta = 0.0,0.8)\).}
  \label{fig:stiffness_finite_size}
\end{figure}
To learn more about the nature of the operators \(Q_1\), \(Q_2\), and \(Q_3\), we have also
examined the contribution of each basis operator \(O_{\gamma}\) to their structure. Specifically,
we have calculated the projections \(\vert \hs{O_{\gamma}}{Q_{\beta}}\vert^2 = \abs{U_{\gamma\beta}}^2\)
and discovered that the largest contributions come from three imaginary (current-like) operators
{\allowdisplaybreaks
\begin{align}
  O_1 & = i \frac{2}{\sqrt{L}} \sum_{\ell=1}^L \left(\Sp_{\ell} \Sm_{\ell+1} - \textrm{H.c.}\right)                      \nonumber     \\
  O_2 & = i \frac{4}{\sqrt{L}} \sum_{\ell=1}^L \left(\Sp_{\ell} \Sz_{\ell+1} \Sm_{\ell+2} - \textrm{H.c.}\right)          \nonumber    \\
  O_3 & = i \frac{8}{\sqrt{L}} \sum_{\ell=1}^L \left(\Sp_{\ell} \Sz_{\ell+1} \Sz_{\ell+2} \Sm_{\ell+3} - \textrm{H.c.}\right)
  \label{eq:fermionic_currents}
\end{align}
}
The adjective \textit{fermionic} describing these currents stems from their image under the Jordan-Wigner transformation
  \(S_j^{+} =\exp\left(-i \pi \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} c_k^{\dagger} c_k\right) c_j^{\dagger}\), 
  \(S_j^{-} =\exp\left(+i \pi \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} c_k^{\dagger} c_k\right) c_j \), 
 \( S_j^z = c_j^{\dagger} c_j- \frac{1}{2} \Id\),
which maps them into currents describing particle hopping between first-, second-, and third-nearest neighbors in a system
of spinless fermions
\begin{align}
  O_1 & \to i \frac{2}{\sqrt{L}} \sum_{\ell=1}^L \left(c_{\ell}^{\dagger} c_{\ell+1} - \textrm{H.c.}\right) \nonumber\\
  O_2 & \to i \frac{4}{\sqrt{L}} \sum_{\ell=1}^L \left(c_{\ell}^{\dagger} c_{\ell+2} - \textrm{H.c.}\right)\nonumber \\
  O_3 & \to i \frac{8}{\sqrt{L}} \sum_{\ell=1}^L \left(c_{\ell}^{\dagger} c_{\ell+3} - \textrm{H.c.}\right)
\end{align}
Interestingly, the kind of terms that constitute operators \(O_2\) and \(O_3\) do not appear in the
long-range spin current studied in the previous chapter. The \(\Sz\) operators sandwiched between
the spin-flip operators \(\Sp\) and \(\Sm\) are responsible for cancellation of the sign
originating from the string operator \(\exp\left(\pm i \pi \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} c_k^{\dagger} c_k\right)\) 
and particularly nice form of the fermionic representations of currents \(O_2\) and \(O_3\).

The dependence of the projections on the parameters is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:projections}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{Figures/projections.jpg}
  \caption{Projections of the LSROs \(Q_{\beta}\) on the local operators \(O_{\gamma}\) defined in~\eqref{eq:fermionic_currents},
    i.e. \(\vert\hs{O_{\gamma}}{Q_{\beta}}\vert^2 = \abs{U_{\gamma\beta}}^2\) for \(\beta = 1,2,3\) and \(\gamma = 1,2,3\).}
  \label{fig:projections}
\end{figure}
We see that the best LSRO, \(Q_1\), has nonzero overlap only with \(O_2\), which is even under the
spin-flip transformation\footnote{Spin-flip transformation maps \(\Sz_{\ell}\) to \(-\Sz_{\ell}\).
  \(\Sp_{\ell}\) to \(\Sm_{\ell}\) and \(\Sm_{\ell}\) to \(\Sp_{\ell}\).}.
Both \(O_1\) and \(O_3\) are odd under this transformation, so they do not contribute to \(Q_1\).
This is a consequence of the orthogonality between even and odd subspaces of operator space \(\mathcal{V}_{\textrm{M}}\)
and in fact, those two spaces can be considered separately to reduce the computational cost.
Observing that \(\lambda_1 \to 1\) as \(\alpha \to \infty\) and \(\vert\hs{O_2}{Q_1}\vert^2 \to 1\) as
\(\Delta\to 0\), we can suspect that this LSRO is a remnant of the energy current operator~\autocite{Zotos1997},
which in the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model is a proper LIOM.
Next, \(Q_2\) has a nonzero overlap only with \(O_1\) and \(O_3\), which are odd under spin flip.
Moreover, the overlap \(\vert\hs{O_1}{Q_2}\vert^2\) is maximal along the line of optimal anisotropy.
Similar behavior is observed for \(Q_3\), but now the overlap with \(O_3\) is maximized for parameters
on the line. However, there is a slight difference in comparison to the previous two LSROs. There are
values of parameters for which \(Q_3\) has overlap with just the odd currents, whereas for others
only with the even one. This is caused by the fact the \(Q_3\), defined as the operator with
the third largest stiffness, can have a completely different structure depending on the parameters of
the model. Nevertheless, the important fact is that for optimal anisotropy, it is the odd
current that contributes the most. Curiously, even though this model cannot be mapped
onto a fermionic system with two-body interactions, numerical evidence points to the existence of long-lived
local, fermionic currents which are the most stable at the line of optimal anisotropy.

Finally, we consider the case \(\tau < \infty\) and look at the eigenvalues
of the overlap matrix \(K^{\tau}\) as functions of \(\Omega = 1/\tau\). This
\(\Omega\)-dependence of the finite-time stiffnesses for the 3 best LSROs,
\(Q_1\), \(Q_2\), and \(Q_3\), is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lsro_eigenvalues}.
The relaxation time of the first LSRO, \(Q_1\), is not very affected by the proximity to the optimal line,
which is expected given its origin as a remnant of the energy current. However, for both
\(Q_2\) and \(Q_3\) we can clearly see that the decay is the slowest for the parameters on the optimal line.
We have thus shown, that the quasiballistic nature is not exclusive to the nonlocal spin current,
but also to a broader class of current-like, local operators.
